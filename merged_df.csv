A year earlier, Larry Nance Jr. approached Pelinka with a similar question.

Nance Jr. and his fiancée, his college girlfriend, were interested in buying a house. He wanted to get a sense of whether the Lakers planned on keeping him around, and Pelinka told him that the Lakers would only trade him if it meant landing one of the game’s three best players. He told him to buy the house, multiple sources confirmed.

Before Nance could get that far, however, he received a call on the morning of Feb. 8, 2018. He and Jordan Clarkson had been traded to Cleveland in a salary dump that cleared cap space for the Lakers to be able to offer two max slots in the summer.",nba

22,"[OC] Every NBA Team Ranked By How Well They Have Performed To Preseason Expectations This Regular Season In 2018-19.
 ------  
  
With the regular season now done and dusted I decided it would be cool to take a look back at every NBA team this season and place them into tiers on the level that they have performed at this season.  
  
- Completely Exceeded Expectations  
- Exceeded Expectations    
- Slightly Exceeded Expectations   
- Met Expectations  
- Slightly Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Didn't Meet Expectations  
- Completely Didn't Meet Expectations  
  
  
I made a very similar post to this one last year and it was very positively received so I decided to try writing another post. Here is a [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8bnnqc/oc_every_nba_team_ranked_by_how_well_they_have/) for anyone interested. Of course every situation is different and so I have factored in the teams overall win-loss record but also how they have responded to difficult situations this season such as injuries or the context of how they have performed.   
  
One thing that I am changing this season compared to this year is how I view situations with ‘disgruntled players.’ Last year this was an issue when trying to rank the Spurs season due to Kawhi’s absence. As a result I have decided that if a players lack of success is due to a disgruntled player and NOT one who is injured this will negatively effect them. (Sorry Pelican fans)  

**This is just my opinion and I am keen to shuffle the list around if people disagree with my results so feel free to leave your input and I will be very willing to take it into consideration. Please don’t be too harsh and I will try to make sure my rankings are as accurate as possible**  
   
------  
  
Just a couple other things to consider:  
  
-  When I state my predicted expectations It as an average of preseason rankings from ESPN, Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, CBS Sports, Action Network and 538. Sources: [ESPN](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24813839/projecting-best-worst-cases-toughest-stretches-all-30-teams), [BR](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2789744-2018-19-nba-schedule-win-loss-predictions-for-every-team#slide2), [CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/sportsline-2018-19-nba-projections-warriors-heavy-favorites-to-three-peat-celtics-raptors-very-close-in-east/), [Action Network]  (https://www.actionnetwork.com/nba/nba-win-totals-betting-odds-2018-2019-warriors-celtics), [538 CARMELO](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2019-nba-predictions/)  
  
- This is the [link] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/9ogb2k/201819_season_predictions_from_the_rnba_power/) to the NBA preseason power ranking predictions that I make reference to in my post.  
   
-----    
  
EDIT: The Boston Celtics were moved from ""Didn't Meet Expectations"" into the lowest category of ""Completely Didn't Meet Expectations."" They were so heavily expected to be the number one seed and never really looked to be close to that this season.
-----    
  
###Completely Exceeded Expectations   
  
- **Milwaukee Bucks** WL Record: 60-22  
  
The Milwaukee Bucks were predicted to win 46 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement about the prospect of new coach Mike Budenholzer. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 19/30 voters expected the Bucks to finish as a top 4 seed. However only 1/30 predicted them to finish with a top 2 seed. To finish the regular season with the NBA’s best win loss record is an incredible achievement that very few saw coming. The success of Milwaukee this season can be attributed to many people but the clear stand out is star forward Giannis Antetoukounmpo. In just his sixth season the Greek Freak had one of the greatest seasons in recent history and is expected to poll very highly in MVP voting. It’s going to come down to the wire between him and James Harden but I could see voters giving him the advantage due to his consistency throughout the year, elite defence and greater team success. The performance of the rest of the team also deserves tremendous credit with Middleton making his first all star appearance and Malcom Brogdon joining esteemed company in the 50-40-90 club. The Bucks will be a team to look out for in the playoffs and Giannis will be looking to make a huge statement to the rest of the sporting world.   
  
.  
  
    
- **Sacramento Kings** WL Record: 39-43        
  
The Sacramento Kings were predicted to win 25 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 23 games. They were viewed as a team that just didn’t have the right mix of players. In the preseason their power forward and centre rotation seemed too tall to be competitive with questions about the backcourt depth of the team.      
In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Kings to feature in the playoffs and while the Kings didn’t qualify for the top 8 in the western conference they were just outside finishing 9th. The Kings had their most successful season in over a decade this season and with the improvement of DeAaron Fox and Buddy Hield they look like a young team with a lot of upside. Sacramento have over $70 million in cap space this offseason so If they can make a splash in free agency they will be a team to look out for.  
  
.  
  
         
- **Brooklyn Nets** WL Record: 42-40          
    

The Brooklyn Nets were predicted to win 32 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a team that could start to turn their future around after many years asa  bottom 5 team in the league, however thats essentially all it was. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Nets to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Nets however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2015 overcoming an 8-18 start to the year to qualify. D’Angelo Russell had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance and emerging as one of the front runners for the most improved player award. The Nets have a lot of money available in free cap space going in to this offseason and with their developing young team they are going to be one to look out for.  
  
.  
  
         
- **Orlando Magic** WL Record: 42-40          
     
The Orlando Magic were predicted to win 30 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 27 games. They were viewed as a team that was going absolutely nowhere in a hurry. Their roster wasn’t rated very highly by many in the league and they seemed to be destined for a bottom seeded finish. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Magic to make the playoffs. Not a single voter. The Magic however would finish the season making their first playoff appearance since 2012 overcoming a 20-31 start to the year to qualify. Nikola Vucevic had a career season which culminated in his first all star appearance, Fournier and Gordon played strong roles and Terrence Ross emerged as a genuine contender for the sixth man of the year award. The Magic shocked everyone this season with their improvement and I’m excited to see how the team builds on this year going forward.
  
.  
  
         
- **Los Angeles Clippers** WL Record: 47-35          
      
The Los Angeles Clippers were predicted to win 34 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 29 games. They were viewed as a deep team but ultimately not a team that would be good enough to go anywhere quickly. The departure of stars Blake Griffin and Chris Paul in recent years lead to many thinking that the Clippers would be more amongst the worst in the league and in competition for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Clippers to make the playoffs but they defied the odds to not just make the playoffs but also almost win 50 games. The key stand out for the Clippers this season with all things considered would have to be Lou Williams who averaged 20 points per game and hit many clutch shots through out the season. The Clippers have their sights set on Kawhi Leonard this offseason and with an already deep roster could be a team to look out for.  
   
.  
  

------  
  
.  
  
###Exceeded Expectations    
  
- **Denver Nuggets** WL Record: 54-28         
    
 
The Denver Nuggets were predicted to win 48 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 47 games. They were viewed as a young and exciting team that was unlucky to miss the playoffs last season with 46 wins. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 25/30 voters expected the Nuggets to make the playoffs but just 2 of those voters expected them to hold home court advantage in the playoffs. The Nuggets encountered a lot of early season injuries but were able to maintain an elite record in large parts due to their outstanding depth. Nikola Jokic had a career season making his first all star appearance and could poll well in MVP voting. Despite all this many people still regard Denver as a bit of a ‘pretender’ that will fail in the playoffs. Time will tell but during the regular season the Denver Nuggets exceeded expectations.  
  
.  
  
  
- **Indiana Pacers** WL Record: 48-34        
   

The Indiana Pacers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 43 games. They were viewed as a team that with a deep roster that was just outside the elite group of the Eastern Conference. After completely shattering expectations last season there was a lot of excitement about the potential of the group. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Pacers to make the playoffs 24/30 voters expecting them to finish 4th or 5th, so you might say that they met expectations completely. However the Pacers started 32-15 this season (a 56 win pace) prior to a season ending injury to star guard Victor Oladipo. Despite the injury the team was able to maintain a strong win loss record. It is unlikely that they advance far in the playoffs but for an awesome start to the season when healthy and maintaining a great level of play despite a serious injury I have decided to say that Indiana exceeded expectations.  
  
.  
  
      
- **Portland Trailblazers** WL Record: 53-29      
   

The Portland Trailblazers were predicted to win 41 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as few as 39 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. After barely improving their roster in the offseason and after being swept in the first round they were expected to fall back. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Blazers to make the playoffs with only one voter expecting them to maintain home court advantage. However as the Trailblazers regularly do they defy peoples expectations and continue to prove themselves as a great team. A late season injury to Jusuf Nurkic in addition to a knee issue from CJ McCollum has people questioning how far they can go in the playoffs but this regular season, Portland has exceeded expectations. 
  
.  
  
        
- **Atlanta Hawks** WL Record: 29-53          
     
   
The Atlanta Hawks were predicted to win 24 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as few as 20 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be amongst the worst in the league and ultimately end up tanking for a high draft pick. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30 voters expected the Hawks to miss the playoffs and they did. The goal for this year was never to make playoffs for Atlanta so that isn’t a concern. The Hawks played better than many had anticipated this season with Trae Young having a sensational rookie season and John Collins playing at an all star calibre level. The team is still young and inexperienced so it would not be realistic to expect them to make a jump to the playoffs very soon. However the Hawks appear to be building something and going in the right direction in their rebuild.

###Slightly Exceeded Expectations

- **Toronto Raptors** WL Record: 58-24           
    
    
   
The Toronto Raptors were predicted to win 56 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as few as 53 games. They were viewed as a clear cut top 5 team that would be even better with the addition of Kawhi Leonard to replace DeMar Derozan. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Raptors to make the playoffs as a top 4 seed. A majority of these voters (24/30) also predicted Toronto to finish as a top 2 seed. The Raptors season was filled with little drama as they ultimately did what they were expected to. However the regular season to an extent didn’t really matter much for the Raptors as their main focus is on making a deep playoff push and as a result Kawhi Leonard was rested for over 20 games this season. As it currently stands the Raptors have met expectations but it all comes down to what happens in the following weeks. An underrated reason for the Raptors success this year has also been Pascal Siakams breakout season. By posting career highs in every stat including doubling his points total from last season he is the strong favourite for the most improved player award.

- **San Antonio Spurs** WL Record: 48-34           
    
      
The San Antonio Spurs were predicted to win 42 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as few as 37 games. They were viewed as a team that would be vulnerable in the race for playoff spots in a competitive Western Conference. Many experts thought that the Spurs run of over 20 consecutive playoff appearances was set to end. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 21/30 voters expected the Spurs to make the playoffs. The Spurs did look vulnerable at times and only had a one game gap for the 8th seed as late as March but they were able to win 9 consecutive matches and clinch their spot. The Spurs will be an interesting team to watch for in the playoffs due to their inconsistencies away from home this season but they could also create a big upset. Ultimately for making the playoffs when many expected a decline I’d say that the Spurs slightly exceeded expectations.

- **Detroit Pistons** WL Record: 41-41           
    
   
The Detroit Pistons were predicted to win 39 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 38 games. They were viewed as a playoff team but almost by default with many expecting them to round out the playoff picture despite a losing record. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 18/30 voters expected the Pistons to make the playoffs. The Pistons were an inconsistent team throughout the regular season going long stretches with few wins but also having remarkable runs of form. Things got close towards the end of the season but Detroit was able to limp towards the playoffs. Blake Griffin had one of his best seasons before knee injuries limited his production in the back end of the season. Its still to be seen just how much of an impact Detroit can make in the playoffs but simply for making it into the top 8 they have met expectations.

- **Utah Jazz** WL Record: 50-32               
     
 
The Utah Jazz were predicted to win 51 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 51 games. They were viewed as a well rounded team that was be able to emerge as a Western Conference threat. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Jazz to make the playoffs and despite starting the season just 14-17 the Jazz would eventually find their groove. Donovan Mitchell had a phenomenal second half of the season following a poor start and Rudy Gobert maintained his elite defence that could see him pick up his second consecutive DPOY award. A lot of Utah’s ranking could come down to how they do in the playoffs in the end but through out the regular season, despite a poor start, as a collective Utah were able to meet expectations and achieve a 50 win season.

- **Philadelphia 76ers** WL Record: 51-31               
    
   
    
The Philadelphia 76ers were predicted to win 53 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 53 games. They were viewed as one of the top 5 teams in the league that with a dynamic young duo would be able to really challenge for a high playoff position. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the 76ers to make the playoffs with 16 of those voters predicting a 3rd placed finish for Philadelphia. The 76ers had the 3rd seed secure for a majority of the season and really didn’t encounter a lot of drama as they progressed throughout the year. Trades for Jimmy Butler and Tobias Harris through out the season have put more pressure on the team to make a deep playoff push and reach all the way for the finals. However as things currently stand, for the regular season, Philadelphia were able to meet expectations with minimal fuss.

- **Memphis Grizzlies** WL Record: 33-49               
    
   
The Memphis Grizzlies were predicted to win 33 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win 33 games. They were viewed as a team that wasn’t quite bad enough to be tanking but not quite good enough to make a run for the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Grizzlies to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Grizzlies had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 12-5 but quickly dropped off from there. The Grizzlies roster changed a lot through out the season a league record 28 players suited up in a Memphis jersey this season. Marc Gasol was traded mid season and the Grizzlies stuck with Mike Conley. It will be interesting to see how they approach the offseason with their current awkwardly constructed roster.

- **Golden State Warriors** WL Record: 57-25                
    
   
The Golden State Warriors were predicted to win 61 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win 60 games. They were viewed as the clear cut best team in the NBA who would be heavy favourites to win their 3rd consecutive championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 27/30 voters expected the Warriors to qualify as the Western Conference number one seed and the other 3 voters picked them as 2nd. The Warriors may not have won as many games as expected this season but for finishing 1st in the West ultimately I am ranking them as having met expectations. The reason is that we all know the Warriors are likely to win the championship and therefore their regular season win total isn’t really a concern. I would be interested to see how other people have seen the Warriors season this year and whether or not this was the right category to place them in.
  
.  
    
        
- **Houston Rockets** WL Record: 53-29               
     
 
The Houston Rockets were predicted to win 55 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 55 games. They were viewed as one of the key contenders to compete with Golden State and challenge for the championship. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 24/30 voters expected the Rockets to qualify as the Western Conference number two seed and all voters predicted them to have home court advantage. The Rockets season was definitely a more difficult one to judge. They began the season 11-14 losing many games that they should not have lost, they then were dealt heavy injury blows to Chris Paul and Clint Capela. However from there became arguably the story of the season. James Harden. The superstar guard would go on an incredible scoring streak scoring at least 30 points in 32 consecutive games and absolutely carrying the team offensively and producing one of the greatest offensive seasons in NBA history. Harden could very well soon be the back to back MVP this season but time will tell how things transpire. Overall for the Rockets they did decrease their win total from 65 games last season but for ultimately finishing with home court in the West despite their injuries they met their expectations. 
  
.  
    
        
- **Charlotte Hornets** WL Record: 40-42                 
    
    
  
The Charlotte Hornets were predicted to win 36 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win 36 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that didn’t really have a clear number 2 option after Kemba Walker. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 7/30 voters expected the Hornets to make the playoffs. It’s a little strange in a way because while the Hornets did essentially meet expectations they will have finished this season as a disappointment. Despite winning a lot more towards the final month of the season the Hornets really left their run till too late. Kemba Walker will enter free agency this off season and with the current state of the Hornets he has a big choice on his mind. Whether he stays or goes Charlotte have a lot to work on this offseason.

The OKC Thunder were predicted to win 50 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as many as 53 games. They were viewed as a team that would with much improved bench depth would be able to solidify themselves as one of the clear cut top teams in the Western Conference. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions all 30/30 voters expected the Thunder to make the playoffs with 20 of those voters predicting home court advantage for OKC. The Thunder began the season in extremely impressive fashion with Paul George looking like an MVP candidate and were 37-19 and within touching distance of the second seed before struggling post all star break. The Thunder failed to secure home court advantage but ultimately did have a great first half of the season so I feel inclined to say that they only slightly failed to meet expectations.

- **Dallas Mavericks** WL Record: 33-49                 
    
    
  
The Dallas Mavericks were predicted to win 35 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as few as 38 games. They were viewed as a young team that would be in the 10-12 range in the standings but finish the season tanking. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Mavericks to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. The Mavericks had their moments through out the year and even started a promising 15-11 but injuries and a drastic midseason roster change lead them in a different direction. Four starers in Jordan, Smith, Barnes and Matthews were all traded to different teams with the Mavericks set to rebuild their future around one key player. Luka Doncic. The biggest highlight of the year was rookie sensation Luka Doncic who averaged 21 points per game and show cased some terrific playmaking skills. Although he struggled a little towards the end of the season Doncic looks like a perennial all star for years to come and should be the favourite for the rookie of the year award.

- **Miami Heat** WL Record: 40-42                
     
    
  
The Miami Heat were predicted to win 43 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 45 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that had achieved a lot of success in seasons past and as a result would be a playoff team due to their defined locker room and team culture. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Heat to make the playoffs but they fell short and were unable to give Dwyane Wade a final full farewell tour. With the retirement of Wade now allowing for a deeper look into the Heat without emotion it appears the future really doesn’t seem too promising for Miami. They are bound by some poor contracts and do not really have a younger star ready to take the reigns. The Heat had an underwhelming season and its hard to see them bouncing back too quickly.

The Chicago Bulls were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 31 games. They were viewed as a young team that was still in the middle of a long term rebuild. They were expected to be a mostly competitive team but ultimately one that didn’t really have a chance to make playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions just 1/30 voters expected the Bulls to make the playoffs and that was an 8th seed. There was some promising development for the Bulls with Zach Lavine having a career season and Lauri Markannen building on a strong rookie season but the glimpses were few and far between. In the end though, the Bulls didn’t have a good season going backwards in wins from the year prior.

- **Washington Wizards** WL Record: 32-50                  
     
The Washington Wizards were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with 538 expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that with the addition of Dwight Howard would be a solidified playoff team. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions almost everyone, 29/30 voters expected the Wizards to feature in the playoffs. An early season injury limited John Wall to just 32 games and Dwight Howard only played 9 games as well which could be to blame for the Wizards lack of success but in reality they had been playing poorly prior to the injury either way. A few mid season trades saw them move Otto Porter and Kelly Oubre for Jabari Parker and Bobby Portis but they were barely anymore successful with them. With John Wall still sidelined all of next season there isn’t a lot of optimism regarding the Wizards and there is a lot of uncertainty about their direction.

- **Minnesota Timberwolves** WL Record: 36-45*                   
       
The Minnesota Timberwolves were predicted to win 44 games in the preseason with Bleacher Report expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a fringe playoff team that would likely be one of the unlucky teams to only just miss out on the playoffs. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only, 3/30 voters expected the Wolves to feature in the playoffs with all three voters putting them as an 8th seed. Early season drama with Jimmy Butler did little to help the team as they would eventually trade him following a 4-9 start. The Wolves had little runs of form but ultimately never really looked like a threat to make a playoff push. A point of optimism for Minnesota through out the year was the resurgence of Derrick Rose who had arguably his best season since his injury troubles. However going forward the Wolves seem to be rather directionless especially with the Andrew Wiggins contract.

The Phoenix Suns were predicted to win 28 games in the preseason with ESPN expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a team, that with the addition of number one draft pick DeAndre Ayton, would finally start to show some improvement and Devin Booker was expected to lead the team back to some semblance of relevance. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected the Suns to feature in the playoffs. Expectations were already low for the Suns but they were expected to be competitive, they were anything but that as they started the season just 4-24 and failed to win even 20 games for the whole year. The Suns will be in the lottery this offseason for the tenth time in eleven years and with some recent draft failures Suns fans will be praying for some success their. Despite being a poor team Phoenix at least seem to have some sort of direction which should eventually bode well for them.

The Boston Celtics were predicted to win 57 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 59 games. After an incredible playoff run the season prior they were viewed as an exciting young super team that would not only be a solid playoff team but many expected the Celtics to be the second best team in the league. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Celtics to finish first in the Eastern conference with the other 7 voters expecting them to finish second. However what ultimately happened was the team would struggle to win 50 games in a season filled with drama. Tatum and Rozier didn’t play as expected, team chemistry issues arose, Hayward failed to recover and Brad Stevens’ coaching was sub par. The Celtics however are still an incredibly talented team and it would not be surprising to see them make the NBA finals. Although it wouldn’t be entirely surprising to see them lose in the first round either. With Kyrie Irvings impending free agency this will be a critical post season push by Boston.

The New York Knicks were predicted to win 27 games in the preseason with Action Network expecting them to win as many as 30 games. They were viewed as a young and inexperienced team that would struggle to win many games especially with a season ending injury to Kristaps Porzingis. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 0/30 voters expected to see New York in the playoffs so its amazing in a way that the  Knicks still underperformed. The Knicks had multiple losing streaks of over 10 games and where the worst team in the NBA for large parts of the season. The Knicks made a huge gamble at the trade deadline effectively trading Porzingis to the Mavericks to free up cap space. It is yet to be seen whether the gamble will pay dividends as the attempt to pursue big name free agents but for having one of the worst records in the NBA this season its fair to say the Knicks failed to meet expectations despite how low they really were. 
  

  
- **New Orleans Pelicans** WL Record: 33-49      
    
The New Orleans Pelicans were predicted to win 45 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 48 games. They were viewed as a team that could really build on a strong playoff run and Anthony Davis was expected to take a step up and become a legitimate MVP candidate. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 23/30 voters expected the Pelicans to feature in the playoffs and instead the Pelicans essentially imploded. Davis requested a trade midseason after an underwhelming season and the Pelicans just fell from there. Davis was placed on a team imposed minutes restriction and the teams lack of depth was severely exposed. Its hard to see what the future holds for New Orleans and it is very much reliant on what unfolds with the Anthony Davis situation and whether they can build around Jrue Holiday going forward.

- **Cleveland Cavaliers** WL Record: 19-63        
    
The Cleveland Cavaliers were predicted to win 31 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 32 games. They were viewed as a veteran team that would struggle following the departure of Lebron James in free agency but would be able to compete for playoffs in a weak Eastern conference. Kevin Love was expected to lead the team and return to his Minnesota form. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions only 7/30 voters expected the Cavaliers to feature in the playoffs but they somehow still underperformed on those expectations. Kevin Love was injured for a majority of the season, Kyle Korver and George Hill were traded, JR Smith disappeared somewhere and the team quickly changed its focus. A positive for Cavalier fans was the development of Colin Sexton in the back half of the season but ultimately to follow 4 straight finals appearances with a bottom 3 record makes the season a major disappointment for the Cavaliers.

- **Los Angeles Lakers** WL Record: 37-45    
  
The Los Angeles Lakers were predicted to win 47 games in the preseason with CBS Sports expecting them to win as many as 49 games. They were viewed as a team that would be on the rise with lots of excitement with the addition of Lebron James to complete and teams exciting young core of emerging talents. In /r/nba preseason power ranking predictions 28/30 voters expected the Lakers to feature in the playoffs, 6/30 voters even predicted them to have home court. However what eventuated was a forgettable season for the Lakers as the underachieved tremendously. Lebron James missed 16 games through injury before infamously being ‘managed’ through the remainder of the year. The Lakers playoff chances weren’t completely ruled as late as February but a horrific stretch of losses against bottom seeded teams late in the season saw them miss the playoffs by quite a margin. Its going to be a long offseason for the Lakers.

**An API Client package to access the APIs for** [**NBA.com**](https://NBA.com)

&amp;#x200B;

As the season ended, I wanted to bring awareness to the NBA API Client I created for Python a few months ago. This will be a great tool for people to use that want to get familiar with data analysis and Python. In addition, I think we may be able to get more Original Content posted to this subreddit!

&amp;#x200B;

This NBA API Client follows the same structure as the APIs on [NBA.com](https://NBA.com). I created a tool that helped map and analyze Endpoints from [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com). I believe this to be the most extensive public documentation on the Stats API endpoints. All of this information can be found in easy to follow documentation. And if you find a way to make it better, feel free to create an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, I have mapped out 108 Endpoints that are available on [stats.nba.com](https://stats.nba.com).

What if conferences were eliminated in the playoffs?

Let's dive in:

Note: In case of identical records I used point differential as the determining factor. Just because it was easier and more convenient for me.

__1. Milwaukee Bucks (60-22)__ - __16. Detroit Pistons (41-41)__    
Surprise motherfuckers, nothing changed.

__2. Toronto Raptors (58-24)__ - __15. Brooklyn Nets (42-40)__    
Well... this is akward.

__3. Golden State Warriors (57-25)__ - __14. Orlando Magic (42-40)__    
Oh my, the Magic are in for a beating.

__4. Denver Nuggets (54-28)__ - __13. LA Clippers (48-34)__    
I guess this would be a nice matchup.

__5. Portland Trail Blazers (53-29)__ - __12. San Antonio Spurs	(48-34)__    
I think the Spurs do have a chance in this one.

__6. Houston Rockets (53-29)__ - __11. Indiana Pacers (48-34)__    
Finally another unexpected matchup. Could the Pacer's squad defend Harden?

__7. Philadelphia 76ers	(51-31)__ - __10. Oklahoma City Thunder (49-33)__    
Ok, this is why we need to pull the trigger on this seeding thing ASAP.

What I mean is this: what game was the closest throughout, with no team having larger than an “X” point lead? I’d have to imagine it’s about 5, as less than that would be astounding. 

Exclude games from pre-shot clock, but we might not have those stats anyway.

Ralph Lawler, the Clippers’ play-by-play announcer for 40+ years, is currently broadcasting his last regular season game tonight, and he is accompanied by former Clipper/current enigma Bill Walton, who is going all out with his color commentary.

Current highlights (all from the first quarter) from Walton so far include:

-Not knowing any player on either team, needing Ralph’s help to name them

-calling Ivica Zubac “Chewiebacca” and predicting that he would become the first Clipper to have his name retired by the team

-Lawler telling a story about doing commentary with Walton in which Michael Olowakandi grabs a rebound in the 3rd quarter, Walton yelling “That’s why the Clippers picked him with the first pick!”, and Lawler noting that that was Olowakandi’s first rebound of the game

-presenting Lawler with a bottle of Jack Daniels as well as a painting (that Walton most likely painted) depicting Ralph’s journey through life

-saying Jazz coach Quin Snyder should resign immediately after a Jazz turnover

-calling Jazz forward Tyler Cavanaugh a “criminal, thug, and infidel” after fouling Jamychal Green on a potential dunk

Update: Walton has changed shirts twice in the second quarter, and is currently wearing his old warmup shirt from his playing days.

He has also forgotten both Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Joe Ingles’ name twice.",nba

Last night: 
OKC came back from down 15 as Russ &amp; PG went nuclear while the man averaging 37 points a game didn't score a single FG in the fourth.

Lakers were up 2 but turned the ball over, got the game tied, and lost to a buzzer-beating shot by MO FUCKING HARKLESS against the Blazers last night.

Denver almost sacrificed the 2 seed but managed to hold on thanks to OKC's heroics.

Tonight: 
Kings were up HUGE tonight and got outscored by 30+ points in the second half as ANFERNEE SIMONS put up 37/9/6 in 48 minutes to clinch the 3 seed despite Dame sitting and Portland's best attempts to throw the game.

Wolves blew a lead late in the game and almost upset the 2 seed Nuggets despite resting everyone.

After it looked almost certain that Houston would clinch the 2 seed last night. Up 15 and Harden almost ripped the heart out of OKC with a wide open game winner. Everything that could have possibly gone wrong for the Rockets/Jazz/Blazers happened and the Thunder clawed back from almost having to face the Dubs round 1 to facing a crippled yet still dangerous Blazers team.",nba

94,"[OC] Why is Portland the 4-seed? An exercise in NBA Tiebreakers
Well, yesterday was fun.

There were a lot of threads and comments asking for clarification on how the rankings were working out.  u/rukqoa [put together a nice flowchart](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bbilwk/oc_handy_dandy_flowchart_for_what_could_happen_to/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) to help people understand in case you missed it.  For me, sometimes it's easier to see how the rules shake out going through them sequentially rather than just as a flow chart.  I did a couple of these tiebreaker threads a few weeks back, but now that we're on the last day of the season and there are still potential ties, I figured it would be a good time to again go through how the tiebreaker rules work.

I'll post the tiebreaker rules at the bottom, if they interest you at all.
#Western Conference
---

#####Current Standings

Rank | Team | Record | Conf. Rec. | Remaining Games
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
\#1* | GSW | 57 - 24 | 35 - 16 | 1
\#2 | DEN | 53 - 28 | 33 - 18 | 1
\#3 | HOU | 53 - 29 | 32 - 20 | -
\#4 | POR | 52 - 29 | 28 - 23 | 1
\#5* | UTA | 50 - 31 | 30 - 21 | 1
\#6 | OKC | 48 - 33 | 28 - 24 | 1
\#7 | SAS | 47 - 34 | 29 - 22 | 1
\#8 | LAC | 47 - 34 | 27 - 24 | 1
*denotes seeding is final |

So, there's potential for two separate 3-way ties in the western conference.  How likely is it to happen?  It's hard to say; DEN tanked their game against POR in an attempt to boost them above HOU and then expected to beat UTA last night, which didn't happen.  Then, after HOU was in control of the 2-seed, they then lose to OKC despite having a 10 point lead late in the 4^th quarter.  What I'm trying to say is - we're all just guessing at this point.

---
##The 2-4 Seeds

Houston can only watch tonight, as they've played all of their 82 games, so DEN and POR will dictate their destiny.  Here's the scenarios:

###DEN Win, POR Win

1. DEN finishes the season 54-28, and wins the 2-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

2. POR finishes the season 53-29 tied with HOU.  As it is a two-team tie, we go into the two-team tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - Head to Head (""H2H""):**  POR won the season series against HOU 2-1, and so POR wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #2 DEN
* #3 POR
* #4 HOU

**Note:**  You may be wondering, *Wait, why* ***isn't*** *POR the 4-seed - HOU is the Southwest Division winner?*  Well, that's actually because of the season when the meme started - the tiebreaker rules were changed so that H2H has priority over division leader, **but only in the case of 2-way tiebreakers**; it's the first tiebreaker when there are more than 2 teams tied.

###DEN Win, POR Loss

1. DEN finishes the season 54-28 and wins the 2-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
2. HOU finishes the season 53-29 and wins the 3-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
3. POR finishes the season 52-30 and wins the 4-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

Easy enough.

###DEN Loss, POR Loss

1. DEN finishes the season 53-29 tied with HOU.  As it is a two-team tie, we go into the two-team tiebreakers.
2. POR finishes the season 52-30 and wins the 4-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:**  HOU won the season series against DEN 3-1, and so HOU wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #2 HOU
* #3 DEN
* #4 POR

###DEN Loss, POR Win (The juicy one)

1. DEN finishes the season 53-29
2. HOU finishes the season 53-29
3. POR finishes the season 53-29

There's a three-way tie in this scenario!  However, we first have to determine the Northwest division winner, according to rule **C.(1)(a)**, so we'll do that with DEN and POR; HOU will sit tight for now.

**A.(1) - H2H:** DEN won the season series against POR 3-1, so DEN would be the Division winner in this scenario.   Rule **C.(1)(b)** says that this tiebreaker only determines division winner, and not seeding - we have to go back to the multi-team tiebreakers now.

**B.(1) - Division Winner:**  Both DEN and HOU are division winners and are still tied, leaving POR as the odd-team out.  They will be the 4-seed, and we move back into the two-team tiebreaker.

**A.(1) - H2H:**  HOU won the season series against DEN 3-1, and so HOU wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #2 HOU
* #3 DEN
* #4 POR

###Section Summary

* If DEN wins, they are the 2-seed.
* If DEN loses, they are the 3-seed.
* If POR wins **and** DEN wins, they are the 3-seed.
* If POR loses, they are the 4-seed.

Got it?  Good - moving on down.

---
##The 6-8 Seeds

OKC's win yesterday against HOU gave them pole-position for the 6-seed.  SAS and LAC both have to win tonight to stay in contention, but they have to hope that OKC loses in order to make sure they avoid GSW.

###OKC Win, SAS and LAC *both* win or *both* lose

1. OKC finishes the season 49-33, and wins the 6-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
2. SAS and LAC both finish the season 48-34 or 47-35, and so we go into the two-team tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:** The season series between the two teams is tied 2-2, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(2) - Division Winner:**  Neither team won their division, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(3) - Best Division Record (same division only)**:  Both teams are in different divisions, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(4) - Best Conference Record:** SAS has a two-game lead in conference play over LAC, so they win the tiebreaker (which matches how the standings are right now, if you were curious).

Seeding would be:

* #6 OKC
* #7 SAS
* #8 LAC

###OKC Win, SAS/LAC Win, LAC/SAS Lose

1. OKC finishes the season 49-33, and wins the 6-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
2. SAS or LAC finishes the season 48-34, and wins the 7-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
3. LAC or SAS finishes the season 47-35, and wins the 8-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

Another easy one, I just combined two scenarios into one here.

###OKC Loss, SAS Win, LAC Loss

1. OKC and SAS finish the season 48-34, and enter into the two-team tiebreakers.
2. LAC finishes the season 47-5, and wins the 8-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:** SAS won the season series against OKC 2-1, and so SAS wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 SAS
* #7 OKC
* #8 LAC

###OKC Loss, SAS Loss, LAC Win

1. OKC and LAC finish the season 48-34, and enter into the two-team tiebreakers.
2. SAS finishes the season 47-5, and wins the 8-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:** The season series between the two teams is tied 2-2, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(2) - Division Winner:** Neither team won their division, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(3) - Best Division Record (same division only):**  Both teams are in different divisions, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(4) - Best Conference Record:**  For LAC to win, they would beat UTA - a conference opponent.  This would boost their conference record to 28-24.  Meanwhile, OKC is playing MIL, a non-conference opponent, so their conference record is unaffected.  Both teams have a conference record of 28-24, so we move on - **N/A**

**A.(5) - Best Record Against Conference Playoff Teams:**  This one will need a new table:

#####OKC &amp; LAC vs. Playoff Opponents
Opp. | OKC | LAC
:---: | :---: | :---:
GSW | 1-2 | 1-3
DEN | 0-4 | 1-3
HOU | 3-1 | 2-1
POR | 4-0 | 1-3
UTA | 4-0 | 1-2
SAS | 1-2 | 2-2
Total | 13-9 | 8-14

OKC has the better record against the other conference playoff teams, so they win the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 OKC
* #7 LAC
* #8 SAS

###OKC Loss, SAS Win, LAC Win

1. OKC finishes 48-34
2. SAS finishes 48-34
3. LAC finishes 48-34

We have another three-way tie!  This time, there's no division winner to worry about first, so we move straight into the multi-team tiebreakers.

**B.(1) - Division Winner:** None of the three won their division, so we move on - **N/A**

**B.(2) - Group H2H:**  Here's how the three teams played against each other:

* The Thunder are 2-2 against LAC and 1-2 against SAS, for a group record of 3-4.

* The Clips are 2-2 against OKC and 2-2 against SAS, for a group record of 4-4. 

* The Spurs are 2-2 against LAC and 2-1 against OKC, for a group record of 4-3.

This tiebreaker busts the whole tie - we don't need to go any deeper.

Seeding would be:

* #6 SAS
* #7 LAC
* #8 OKC

###Section Summary
* If OKC wins, they are the 6-seed.
* If SAS wins **and** OKC loses, they are the 6-seed.
* If SAS wins **and** OKC wins, they are the 7-seed.
* If LAC wins **and** SAS loses, they are the 7-seed.
* If OKC loses **and** SAS wins **and** LAC wins, they are the 8-seed.

Whew, lad.

#Eastern Conference

#####Current Standings
Rank | Team | Record | Conf. Rec. | Remaining Games
:---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---:
\#1* | MIL | 60 - 21 | 40 - 12 | 1

\#8 | DET | 40 - 41 | 26 - 25 | 1
\#9 | CHA | 39 - 42 | 29 - 22 | 1
*denotes seeding is final |

Not quite as cool as the west, but there are still ramifications for tonight, with one team still fighting to make the playoff cut.  We'll do 6-8 first, and then 8-9 separately.

##The 6-8 Seeds

This removes CHA from consideration.

###BKN Win, ORL Win, DET Win

1. Both BKN and ORL finish the season tied at 42-40, and go into the two-team tiebreakers.
2. DET finishes the season 41-41, and wins the 8-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:**  BKN won the season series against ORL 2-1, and so BKN wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 BKN
* #7 ORL
* #8 DET

###BKN Loss, ORL Win, DET Win

1. ORL finishes the season 42-40, and wins the 6-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
2. Both BKN and DET finish the season tied at 41-41, and go into the two-team tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:** BKN won the season series against DET 2-1, and so BKN wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 ORL
* #7 BKN
* #8 DET

###BKN Win, ORL Loss, DET Win

1. BKN finishes the season 42-40, and wins the 6-seed free and clear - no tiebreakers.
2. Both ORL and DET finish the season tied at 41-41, and go into the two-team tiebreakers.

**A.(1) - H2H:** DET won the season series against ORL 3-1, and so DET wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 BKN
* #7 DET
* #8 ORL

###BKN Loss, ORL Loss, DET Win

1. BKN finishes 41-41.
2. ORL finishes 41-41.
3. DET finishes 41-41.

Yet another three-way tie is possible!  There's a division winner in this mix, so that's going to affect seeding.

**B.(1) - Division Winner:** ORL won the Southeast division (congrats?), and so they win this tiebreaker.  We move into the two-team tiebreakers now.

**A.(1) - H2H:** BKN won the season series against DET 2-1, and so BKN wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #6 ORL
* #7 BKN
* #8 DET

###Section Summary

* If BKN wins, they are the 6-seed.
* If ORL wins **and** BKN loses, they are the 6-seed.
* If DET wins **and** ORL loses, they are the 7-seed.
* If BKN wins **and** ORL wins, DET will be the 8-seed.

##The 8-9 Seeds

CHA is back!

###DET Win *OR* CHA Loss

1. DET (with win) finishes the season 41-41, and CHA already has 42 losses - they would be eliminated.
2. CHA (with loss) finishes the season 39-43, and would also be eliminated.

Seeding would be:

* #8 DET
* #9 CHA

###DET Loss, CHA Win

1. DET finishes the season 40-42.
2. CHA finishes the season 40-42.

We enter the two-way tiebreakers here:

**A.(1) - H2H:** CHA won the season series against DET 4-0, and so CHA wins the tiebreaker.

Seeding would be:

* #8 CHA
* #9 DET

###Section Summary

* If DET wins, they are the 8-seed.
* If CHA wins **and** DET loses, they are the 8-seed.
* If CHA loses, they are the 9-seed.

#TL;DR
---

###Western Conference
* If DEN wins, they are the 2-seed.
* If DEN loses, they are the 3-seed.
* If POR wins **and** DEN wins, they are the 3-seed.
* If POR loses, they are the 4-seed.
* If OKC wins, they are the 6-seed.
* If SAS wins **and** OKC loses, they are the 6-seed.
* If SAS wins **and** OKC wins, they are the 7-seed.
* If LAC wins **and** SAS loses, they are the 7-seed.
* If OKC loses **and** SAS wins **and** LAC wins, they are the 8-seed.

###Eastern Conference
* If BKN wins, they are the 6-seed.
* If ORL wins **and** BKN loses, they are the 6-seed.
* If DET wins **and** ORL loses, they are the 7-seed.
* If BKN wins **and** ORL wins **and** DET wins, DET will be the 8-seed.
* If CHA wins **and** DET loses, they are the 8-seed.
* If CHA loses, they are the 9-seed.

#Appendix
---
[Link to source on rules \(at the bottom\).](https://www.nba.com/standings)

#####A. Two-Team Tiebreakers

**(1)** Head-to-head record (hereafter ""H2H"")

**(2)** Division Winner

**(3)** Best Division record (only if tied teams are in the same division)

**(4)** Best Conference record

**(5)** Best record against playoff teams in conference

**(6)** Best record against playoff teams in **opposite** conference

**(7)** Best point differential for the season (total points scored less total points allowed)

#####B. Multi-Team Tiebreakers

**(1)** Division Winner

**(2)** H2H record against group of tied teams

**(3)** Best Division record (only if **all** tied teams are in the same division)

**(4)** Best Conference record

**(5)** Best record against playoff teams in conference

**(6)** Best point differential for the season

#####C. Guidelines for Applying the Tie-Breakers

**(1)(a)** Division winner ties must be broken before any other tie (including seeding)

**(1)(b)** When a tiebreaker is used to determine division winner, it is only used for that purpose and not for seeding.

**(2)** With multi-team tiebreakers, the tiebreakers will follow section B.'s rules until the first of the following:

**(2)(a)** Each tied team has achieved a ranking according to record or point differential, or

**(2)(b)** One or more (but not all) of the tied teams has achieved a ranking according to record or point differential.  In this instance, the remaining tied teams will begin the process anew, starting at either rule A.(1) or B.(1), based on number of tied teams remaining.

**(3)** If all that fails, fuck it - we'll do a random drawing.

117,"Possible NBA coverup of Magic Johnson Expose?
Hi all,

So with all the drama surrounding Magic Johnson and the Lakers stemming from last night, one piece of info that has been mentioned but not really talked about is the story ESPN has apparently been writing. This supposed story, which has been confirmed my multiple insider's, apparently details workplace abuse committed by Magic.

Now of course no one knows the details, but Magic himself confirmed the story was being written by defending himself in his presser last night, “That story is wrong,” Johnson told the Los Angeles Times.

The biggest piece of news that no one is talking about, is that today, on Undisputed, Chris Broussard said he heard about the story back in November and at the time it was expected to come out within ""a few weeks"". Broussard then goes on to say he figured the NBA and Lakers ""convinced ESPN not to do the article"". He continues to say he figured the story was squashed when it never was released.

Now listen, I know Broussard is a meme around here and he has deserved it. The fact is, he went on the air this morning and publically commented that the NBA and ESPN might have worked together to essentially cover up the Magic Johnson abuse expose. 

I have seen 0 people talking about this. This is a huge deal. We know the article is real and has been in the works since at least November. Obviously there is a lot we do not know, but this should be taken more seriously. 

What are your thoughts? 

Tldr; Chris Broussard said live, on air, that he figured ""The Lakers and the league got ESPN not do due the article"", referring to a confirmed article being written about potential workplace abuse committed by Magic Johnson.",nba

125,"The amount of things that had to happen to get the Houston/Utah series is just mind boggling for me...
Let's go back to Tuesday night, Utah beats Denver and Denver has a chance to fall to 3, this isn't important until later, Utah didnt want to play Houston first round and Utah's chances of playing Portland first round were ridiculously high, so here's how it didn't happen:

First game: HOU at OKC: Houston had a big lead in the 4th, if Houston wins then Utah would've played Portland however if the thunder come back, there's a chance Houston falls, thunder go on to come back and win with an insane 3 from PG from the corner..

Second game: POR at LAL, Lakers came back and had a 2 point lead with 40ish seconds to go, Mo harkless hits a 2 with around 30 seconds to tie it up, Caruso loses the ball to Lillard who would give it to harkless for the win from the corner (correct me if I'm wrong on the players it was blurry)

Tonight:

Third game: MIN at DEN: all Utah needs to play Portland was a loss from Denver or Portland so Minnesota led this game by 11 with 3 minutes, Denver would come back and hit clutch 3s to win this game. 

Fourth and final deciding game: Sac at POR: Sacramento led this game by 28 points!! 28!! But Utah's curse was in the building and Sacramento would rest their starters so Portland would come back and win this game...

As a jazz fan, this is just shocking, Houston was the last team we wanted to play but now we have to accept it. Should be an exciting playoffs. This is why I love the NBA though, crazy things happen, comebacks happen, somehow this playoff series is happening. If PG misses his 3, jazz play Portland, if Caruso scores, jazz play Portland, if wolves hung on, jazz play Portland, if sac keeps their starters in, jazz play Portland, but none of that happened.

Full tweet: 

&gt;Tyus Jones has made NBA history. He finishes the season with a 6.8 to 1 assist-to-turnover ratio, becoming the NBA's all time leader in single season a:to and the first player to post a 6:1 ratio in a full season (previous leader was Muggsy Bogues at 5.94)

 Q&amp;A with Ralph Lawler: On retirement, his Clipper favorites, Bill Walton and the franchise’s future 

 

**Buha: You’re going to be calling Wednesday’s game with former Clipper and your former broadcast partner Bill Walton. Bill is well known for many things, including his Hall of Fame career, but he’s also known to have an eccentric personality. What’s your best Bill Walton story?**

**Lawler:** I guess my lasting memory of Bill will be one night when Jo and I were living down in Orange County, 13, 14 years ago. The phone rings and it’s Bill. And he said, “I’m arranging a whitewater rafting trip down the Colorado River, through the Grand Canyon. Eighteen days, 17 nights. Do you guys want to go?” I go, “Whoa.” And I said, “Let me check with Jo.” Because there’s no electricity, no hot and cold running water, no restrooms, no cell-phone service. You were out there in the wild just as the early explorers were. I explain all this to Jo and she says, “Yeah, this sounds great.” I go, “Wow.” I call Bill back and he winds up being the host to 15 or 16 of his best friends and we were lucky enough to be included in that group. We had the absolute adventure of a lifetime.",nba

Despite the trades, the injuries, and the coaching changes, the Raptors remain a consistently top-tier team. Very thankful to the front office, the team, the coaching staff, and the entire organization. Since Bosh left in 2010, every year has become progressively more optimistic. Plenty of risks along the way have allowed the team to grow, and have kickstarted this upward trend (building around Kyle and DeMar, picking up prospects of little interest like Siakam and VanVleet). The risks taken this year have so far panned out during the regular season (firing Casey, hiring Nurse, trading DeMar and Poeltl for Kawhi and Danny, trading the younger JV for a twilight-era Gasol), and hopefully this team can lead the franchise to a level it's never reached before. I'll still be happy whether Kawhi stays or leaves - the team did everything they could, Kawhi has been nothing but professional and committed, and Masai has built a bright future for this franchise. But hopefully this roster can give Toronto its first Finals appearance before that decision is made.

Nothing but respect for what Giannis and Bud have done. Impressed by the moves the 76ers have made. Boston is still scary. Pacers keep on proving everyone wrong, and have the best cheers in the league. Dlo is an inspiration, and the Nets have been fire. Magic have made an incredible playoff push.

In an article for the Athletic, Anthony Slater catalogued the progression of KD's mid-range efficiency over the course of his career, and the leap he has taken this year is astounding. The numbers tell the story:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Season|Team |Mid-range Percentage|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008-2009|OKC|37.3|
|2009-2010|OKC|39.7|
|2010-2011|OKC|41.6|
|2011-2012|OKC|46.4|
|2012-2013|OKC|45.3|
|2013-2014|OKC|44.4|
|2014-2015|OKC|49.0|
|2015-2016|OKC|49.5|
|2016-2017|GSW|47.3|
|2017-2018|GSW|49.4|
|2018-2019|GSW|54.8|

&amp;#x200B;

As someone known as a mid-range god, this kind of ascension in efficiency is unprecedented. From the 15-19 foot range, DeMar DeRozan, Klay Thompson, and Lamarcus Aldridge have all taken 240 or more mid range jumpers. DeRozan has made 39.5%, Aldridge has made 41.2% and Thompson has made 45.1%. KD leads the pack with **57%. Man is Different.**",nba

325,"How Dirk changed the NBA
Some eye-popping stats about Dirk's twenty-one seasons in the league:

Before Dirk made his NBA debut in 1998, a total of forty 7-footers had hit a three-pointer. The combined total from those forty players was 507 made three-pointers. In his career, Dirk made 1,982 three-pointers. Since entering the league, 81 other 7-footers have hit a total of 7,253 three-pointers.

&amp;#x200B;

Top five seven-footers in career threes made:

5. Brook Lopez (436)

4. Kelly Olynyk (473)

3. Andrea Bargnani (627)

2. Channing Frye (1,049)

1. Dirk Nowitzki (1,980)

You can combine second and third place and you'd still be 304 threes short of Dirk's total.

&amp;#x200B;

Dirk is only one of five players with 500+ playoff minutes to average 25+ points/game and 10+ rbs/game (Hakeem, Elgin Baylor, Bob Pettit, and AD are the others), Of those players, Dirk leads in playoff win shares (23.13 playoff win shares),

332,"[OC] NBA Regular Season Championship 2018-2019
Hello r/nba; the regular season has come to an end, and that means we completed the first annual NBA Regular Season Championship.

***What is the Regular Season Championship?*** you ask:

The Regular Season Championship works in the same vein of Boxing or MMA championship matches, where the champion is always defending against a new challenger until he loses, and the challenger takes on the champion “role”.

The inaugural champion for this was last year’s actual NBA Champion: the Warriors. From there on out, there was a total of 38 champions from 24 different teams. Here are the records from the season:

* The Nuggets held the championship a record 4 times.

* The longest a team held a championship was for 21 days, an achievement made by the Spurs

* The shortest a team held a championship was for 1 day, a 3-way tie with the Cavaliers (Twice), Nets, and Spurs.

* The Spurs had the most successful reign, having 8 wins while defending their second championship.

* The top 3 longest reigns:
* 1.Spurs-21 days
* 2.Warriors-16 days
* 3.Raptors-10 days

* The top 3 for overall wins:
* 1.Spurs-14 wins
* 2.Warriors-9 wins
* 3.Nuggets/Trail Blazers-7 wins

* The top 3 teams in average score:
* 1.Warriors-126.0
* 2.Clippers-124.0
* 3.Hawks-123.5

* Only one team was never a challenger throughout the season: the Timberwolves (as a fan of the team I am quite displeased)

The last champions of the season were the Trail Blazers, and they will be the first champions of next season.

Leading Player Stats were also calculated for each reign:

* Top 3 PPG:
* 1.James Harden-42.2
* 2.Paul George-40.0

* 3.James Harden-39.0

* Top 3 APG:
* 1.Nikola Jokic-11.30
* 2.Russell Westbrook/Trae Young-11.00
* 3.Chris Paul-10.00

* Top 3 RPG:
* 1.Joel Embiid-18.50
* 2.Andre Drummond-17.33
* 3.Andre Drummond-16.50

* Top 3 SPG:
* 1.Evan Fournier/Victor Oladipo/PJ Tucker/Andre Drummond-3.00
* 2.Thaddeus Young-2.67
* 3.(Lebron James/Lonzo Ball)/(Marvin Williams/Jeremy Lamb)/Larry Nance Jr.(2x)-2.50

* Top 3 BPG:
* 1.Myles Turner/LaMarcus Aldridge-3.00
* 2.JaVale McGee/Alec Burks-2.50
* 3.Andre Drummond-2.33

333,"Previewing and predicting all the NBA Matchups
So as a heads up, I'm not going to be predicting the number of games a team will need to win, just which team will come out on top.

**Eastern Conference:**

Bucks (1) vs Pistons (8): the Bucks swept the 4-game regular season series with the Pistons, and aside from a 3 point victory on December 17, all the games were blowouts. Prediction: **Bucks**

Raptors (2) vs Magic (7): the Magic gave the Raptors a lot of trouble in the regular season, splitting the 4-game season series. They lost the first matchup by 2 points, then proceeded to beat the Raptors by 29 and 15 points. They lost the last game by 12, but they played a good game. Although playoff inexperience will eventually catch up to the Magic, they'll put up a good fight. Prediction: **Raptors, but the Magic get a moral victory FWIW**

76ers (3) vs Nets (6): similar to the Magic, the Nets also gave the Sixers some trouble in the regular season, splitting the 4-game season series. Don't get me wrong, the 76ers have a great team. But especially with D'Angelo's recent play, the 76ers would be wrong to sleep on this Nets team. Prediction: **76ers, but with the highest upset potential of any series in the East**

Celtics (4) vs Pacers (5): the Celtics dominated the 4-game regular season series, with their only loss coming at the hands of a Victor Oladipo game-winning 3 late. And with Oladipo not playing, the Pacers have regressed. I don't think missing Smart is going to affect the Celtics at this point in the playoffs. Prediction: **Celtics**

**Western Conference:**

Warriors (1) vs Clippers (8): the Warriors dominated the 4-game regular season series, taking 3 of 4 and their only loss coming in OT and without Steph Curry playing. Give the Clippers a ton of credit, but they showed in the last 2 matchups that they didn't match up too well with Golden State. Prediction: **Warriors**

Nuggets (2) vs Spurs (7): don't be fooled by the Nuggets high seeding. There is huge upset potential in this series. The Spurs split the season series with the Nuggets, and all games save for the last one (a Nuggets blowout) were close. You can give me hate for saying this, but the Nuggets might be one of the most inexperienced 2-seeds in history in terms of playoff experience. That being said, I still hesitate to say that San Antonio wins because in terms of playoff experience this iteration is pretty meh too. Plus, it's about time the Nuggets won a playoff series. Prediction: **Nuggets, but don't be surprised if it goes 6 or even 7 games.**

Blazers (3) vs Thunder (6): this might be the TOUGHEST series to call. Why? Because neither team has proven consistent in the first round. The Thunder swept the 4-game season series, although all of the games were close. I get that this current iteration of the Thunder hasn't made it past the first round yet, but I'm still calling upset on this one. Prediction: **Thunder for the upset.**

Rockets (4) vs Jazz (5): it's a shame the Rockets had to fall to the 4th seed, because they're much better than the Blazers and Nuggets this year. Blame their early season struggles for that. So although Houston split the 4-game regular season series with Utah, Houston winning the latter 2 deserves more weight. Also, Utah won't be stopping James Harden. Prediction: **Rockets**.",nba

363,"The quick case for Juwan Howard as Lakers coach
Last week oddsmakers gave Juwan Howard the edge to become the Lakers new head coach, should the position open up this summer. This goes against seemingly more reasonable choices like Ty Lue, Byron Scott, Brian Shaw, or letting Luke run it back. But maybe it shouldn't...

Point #1: Howard is a former teammate of Lebron's on the Spoelstra/Pat Riley culture machine. He has a pre-existing relationship with James, knows how to work with him, and has his respect. As we've all seen these past few years, when your team has Lebron, you have to find someone who fits that mold as a coach. 

Point #2: Again, Howard is from the Spoelstra/Pat Riley culture machine. Other than the Spurs, is there a better system in the league for churning out great coaches? Who would have thought 10 years ago that Eric Spoelstra would turn out to be one of the best coaches in the game? Juwan is ready for his shot. Lakers faithful could be happy to see a Pat Riley disciple on the bench. 

Point #3: Howard and Rob Pelinka were teammates in college. So if anyone is going to overlook candidates with head coaching experience and give Juwan his shot, it could certainly be Pelinka. 

Point #4: The Fab Five. Even though it was 25years ago, the Fab Five is still regarded as basketball royalty among NBA players, and Juwan was the most mature of the bunch by miles. The odds of him losing the locker room are slim.  

Point #5: Money. An established head coach will cost more, and getting rid of Luke will already cost the team a fair bit. In keeping Pelinka to avoid the $20mil payout, Jeanie has shown that they won't be throwing good money after bad. Juwan will be a bargain compared to the other options.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe this is crazy, but I for one would love to see Juwan manning the sidelines sometime soon, and I think this Lakers team is the best spot for him.",nba

369,"Who do you think has the best chance to take down GS this year?
In my opinion the teams that have the best chance in are Houston, Milwaukee, Boston, Toronto, philly. I say Houston due to the fact that they took GS to 7 and might’ve won if cp3 didn’t go down, plus harden is just ridiculous and if he can play as good in the postseason as he did in the regular season, I think they’ll win the ring. Boston due to their depth and if there’s no injuries (besides smart) and everyone plays great I think they match up well with GS. Milwaukee due to Giannis and being almost unstoppable (yet to see in the postseason) and their shooting. Toronto due to kawhi and his defense and Toronto has looked great this season with gasol and Lin as late pickups. Philly cuz embiid and if the starters play great that’s a nasty starting 5",nba
370,"4 teams lost 60 games or more this year. Only 1 team won 60 games.
The 60+ loss teams are:

* Knicks: 65
* Cavs: 63
* Suns: 63
* Bulls: 60

And the only 60-win team is:

* Milwaukee: 60

In comparison, the splits in the last 5 seasons were:

* 2017-18 season: 2 60+ loss teams (PHX, MEM), 1 60+ win team (HOU)
* 2016-17 season: 1 60+ loss team (BKN), 2 60+ win teams (GSW, SAS)
* 2015-16 season: 3 60+ loss teams (PHI, LAL, BKN), 2 60+ win teams (GSW, SAS)
* 2014-15 season: 4 60+ loss teams (MIN, NYK, PHI, LAL), 2 60+ win teams (GSW, ATL)
* 2013-14 season: 2 60+ loss teams (MIL, PHI), 1 60+ win team (SAS)

The disparity this year is the most it's been since the 14-15 season; there  is a pretty substantial divide between the bottom 4 teams and the next teams on the standings, showing how intense the race to the bottom was among this year's four. 

Also interesting how Milwaukee went from the worst record in the league (15-67, a reverse Celtics) to the best record in the league (60-22, the Bud special) in only 5 years.",nba

All of these guys have multi-million dollar psy op campaigns run against them when they want to leave their team. That's it. Team owners are very rich and have a media apparatus. By creating negative publicity for players, they can lower their value. 

That's why we all love KD when he's giving speeches, and Kyrie is an asshole when he makes noises about leaving (and remember he's not forcing his way off the team or anything, his contract is just ending) and Jimmy Butler is a team destroying psychopath, and Kawhi is a quitter controlled by his uncle even when he literally says nothing at all to the media.

You are not learning anything about these players whether they're good guys or bad guys or whatever. It is not a coincidence that NBA players are treated like scum in the media whenever they change teams. Really small events like Davis just wearing a shirt or walking through a hallway are purposely published to make him look like a deceitful little shit.

As long as you're under a long contract with team control, the media doesn't come for your throat. Dame, Kemba, Conley, whatever. 

But when you start to exercise your own agency, the situation changes. Right now Giannis is everybody's sweetheart but if he doesn't re-up with Milwaukee, there will be stories posted to make him look like an asshole and people will be like: ""oh, I ALWAYS knew he was a douchebag"".

Highlights from the Bald Mamba, Alex Caruso.

Through the dysfunction of the Lakers 18-19 season, Alex Caruso performed well.

Over his last 6 games: 

18.2 **PPG** 4.5 **RPG** 8.0 **APG** 1.8 **SPG** 43.8% **FG** 55% **3FG**

427,"Would it be possible for a team to foul a shooter after the buzzer sounds?
We came close to seeing this happen tonight in Atlanta, when Edmond Sumner was fouled on a 3 pointer with 0.3 seconds on the clock. So here's the scenario I'm talking about:

1. Team A is down 1 late in the game
2. Player A on Team A shoots the ball with just tenths of a second left, say 0.1 seconds
3. Buzzer sounds
4. Player B on Team B commits a shooting foul but AFTER the buzzer sounds
5. The ball does not go in the basket

In this case, what would the refs do?

1. Not award the free throws. The shooting foul was committed after the buzzer, so it would not count.
2. Award the free throws with 0.0 on the clock. If Player A is able to put the team ahead via those awarded free throws, Team A gets a walk off win.
3. Award the free throws but reset the clock to 0.1 seconds. I could imagine option 2 would cause a ton of confusion in certain cases. For example, what if the shot in the above scenario was an attempted 3-pointer? If case 2 was invoked, and Player A makes the first two free throws, does Player A have to take the third shot even though there's no way Team B can win at that point. Resetting the clock to 0.1 seconds under option 3 would prevent such a mess.",nba

&amp;#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/bbzvj7/video/5gd02fknlmr21/player

As an over 40 player, I’ve watched Harden riverdance his way around the arc many times, shaking my head and decrying the referees. After watching many clips I've vacillated on the topic and it’s not made easier with a lack of slow motion replays as well as the mix of inevitable no calls at game pace, meaning you can’t get a good, formal, and consolidated view. I decided I needed to work it out for myself, and this video is me trying to do that. I’ve combined what I think are rule changes (since my time when I was actually playing seriously - I miss the 90’s!) in both the gather step and the jump stop, slowed it down (it wasn’t very fast anyway) and put some explanations in there.

432,"Neutral fans - which Eastern Conference playoff match up are you most excited for?
It's that time of the year again. Feels pretty crazy having an Eastern Conference playoffs without Lebron. Nevertheless, someone has to be crowned in the east. Now that this half of the bracket is set in stone, which match ups are you guys most hyped for as neutral fans? Do you guys suspect any potential upsets?

&amp;#x200B;

**(1) Milwaukee Bucks vs. (8) Detroit Pistons:**

Bucks swept season series 4-0. Led by MVP candidate Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks have looked like contenders all season and are sitting pretty as the only 60-win team in the league. It's been an up and down season for the Pistons, but they managed to get to .500 and are happy to be in the playoffs, but Blake's injury is definitely a concern. They've matched up four times before in the playoffs, with the Pistons winning every series.

&amp;#x200B;

**(4) Boston Celtics vs. (5) Indiana Pacers:**

Celtics won season series 3-1. The Celtics have been put to the test this season and would have very much appreciated a lot less drama and negative media coverage, but it would be a safe bet that the 2018 Eastern conference runner-ups return to top form in the playoffs. The Pacers are without their star guard Victor Oladipo but have managed to persevere despite losing him. This could be an interesting one if Pacers steal a game in Boston. These teams are no strangers in the playoffs and have matched up five times before, with Celtics in the lead 3-2.

&amp;#x200B;

**(3) Philadelphia 76ers vs. (6) Brooklyn Nets:**

Split the season series 2-2. 76ers are loaded with talent and have made some nice upgrades to their roster from last year's playoffs. They aren't favored as much as Milwaukee and Toronto but in my opinion, Philly is the dark horse team of the East if their stars get hot. The Nets have had a very tough couple of years but are back in the playoffs after a great season and are ready to make some noise. These teams have met twice before in the playoffs back in the 80's and 70's, splitting each series.

&amp;#x200B;

**(2) Toronto Raptors vs. (7) Orlando Magic**

Split the season series 2-2. Raptors have looked awesome all season and playoff Klaw is ready to go to win a championship for Toronto. The Magic have been surging since the all-star break, so Toronto can't underestimate them. The last and only time these teams met in the playoffs was in the first round of 2008 when the Magic, led by Dwight Howard, would go on to defeat the Raptors in 5 games.",nba

454,"[Serious] First tie-breaker should be points differential
As a blazer fan I am happy with the way things worked out. However if Adam Silver is serious about eliminating tanking, then what happened the other night when Denver visited Portland should not be allowed to happen again.        

 &amp;nbsp;   



Hence, I believe the first and most important tie breaker should be - Total Point Differential. The playoffs should be set in order of the best, not the relative best. A teams total body work should reflect in the standings, not just a 3/4 game series that could have been affected by multiple mitigating circumstances - ie back to backs, travel, injuries etc. Over the whole season, this will even out for both / all teams involved so it is a fairer way of setting the standings.        

 &amp;nbsp; 


Here's how this seasons ties would be broken using this method:     

EASTERN CONFERENCE: 

 &amp;nbsp; 

[](/BKN)BROOKLYN NETS (6) - -3    

 &amp;nbsp; 

[](/ORL)ORLANDO MAGIC (7) = 58     

&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;nbsp;  


WESTERN CONFERENCE:

&amp;nbsp; 

[](/POR) PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS (3) - 344

 &amp;nbsp; 

[](/HOU) HOUSTON ROCKETS (4) - 391       

 &amp;nbsp; 

 &amp;nbsp; 


[](/SAS) SAN ANTONIO SPURS (7) - 138 

 &amp;nbsp;  

[](/LAC) LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS (8) - 70  


 &amp;nbsp;  


So the Magic would move up in the east and face the Sixers, while the Nets give Masai Ujiri further opportunities to hurl obscenities at them when they meet the Raptors. 

Meanwhile out west, Portland would drop to 4th and Houston would be 3rd. There would be no change to the Clips and Spurs.   

The points differentials themselves are not even that much, so you could see teams trying the opposite of what Denver did: Trying harder for longer to try maintain a large lead, maybe even running up the score in blowouts.",nba

456,"Some MVP stats for Bucks and Rockets fans...
With the MVP race settling on Harden vs. Giannis, here are some MVP stats that might appeal to the Bucks and Rockets fans here.

* Throughout the history of the NBA, ~51% of the Finals matchups included the team that had the regular season MVP. And, perhaps not surprisingly, if the team with the MVP makes it to the Finals, that team wins 73% of those Finals series.

* If Harden wins his second MVP this year, coach Mike D'Antoni will have been the coach of the MVP for **four times** in his career. This would make him the third-most ""winningest"" coach, only surpassed by Red Auerbach (coached for 6 MVP awards) and Phil Jackson (coached for 5 MVP awards).

* If Giannis wins it this year, he'll be one of the younger MVP award winners at age 24. The average age of the MVP winner is 27.27 years old. The youngest player to win the MVP was Derrick Rose, at age 22. The oldest was Karl Malone at age 35.

* If Harden wins he'll have nabbed back-to-back MVPs. Winning back-to-back MVPs isn't especially rare. 13 of the 33 individuals who have won the MVP award to-date, have won it multiple times. And of those 13, 11 have won it in back-to-back years at some point in their career. The only two players who won multiple MVP awards but never won any back-to-back are: Bob Pettit ('56 and '59) and Karl Malone ('97 and '99).

* If Harden wins the MVP this year then the Rockets franchise will have amassed a total of 5 MVP awards (2 for Moses, 1 for Hakeem, 2 for Harden). That's pretty good. Only one other team has 5 MVP winners (the 76ers), and only three other franchises will have had more than 5 MVP awards: the Bulls (6); the Lakers (8); and the Celtics (9).

* If Giannis wins the MVP, the Bucks franchise will have nabbed their 4th MVP award (Kareem won the other 3), tying them with Houston for 5th place.

* Good news for Bucks fans. The Rockets record this year is 53-29. There has only been one other MVP in League history whose team won ""only"" 53 games - the Bucks in the 1976-77 season. The Bucks, on the other hand, boast a 60-22 record. This record has been shared by three other teams with MVP winners in the past: the Knicks in the 1969-70 season; the Lakers in the 1979-80 season; and the Spurs in the 2002-03 season.",nba

\---Michael Jordan - 60-win seasons: FIVE. Highest single-season win total: 72. Also, worth noting he won 69 and 67 in other seasons. Won 60 games consecutively in 91-92 and 96-98.

\---Tim Duncan - 60-win seasons: SEVEN (including 99 and 12 lockouts by win %).

Also won over 60 in 2014, when he was no longer in his prime \[NOTE - Edited because I initially had the number wrong, which is why this is out of order\].

\---Kobe Bryant - 60-win seasons: THREE. Highest single-season win total: 67, although he was only in his 4th season when that happened. Highest without Shaq - 65. I think it's fair to say he played a large part in the 2000 season, but he wasn't the best player on the team. Also, the Lakers won 61 in 1998 when he was in only his second season in the league.

\---Shaq - 60-win seasons: THREE. Highest single-season win total: 67.

\---LeBron - 60-win seasons: THREE. Highest single-season win total: 66 (twice). Notable - his teams have not won 60 games in a season since 2013.

\---Steph - 60-win seasons: THREE. Highest single-season win total: 73, also won 67 twice. Two of the Dubs 60-win seasons were pre-KD. As far as his legacy, he's on the short list of players who have unequivocally been the best player on multiple 60-win teams.

\---KD - 60-win seasons: TWO. Highest single-season win total: 67. One 60-win season pre-ruining the NBA.

\---Hakeem - NONE (Thought this was fascinating).

Other notable mentions: Nash had THREE 60-win seasons, two as the leader of the 7SOL Suns and one on the Mavs before Cuban let him walk in free agency. Dirk has THREE as well, all of which as the best player on the team, although his best regular season (his MVP year), also ended the most tragically.

I didn't want to get into the pre-merger era because those were such different times, but worth noting Kareem played on EIGHT 60-win teams!",nba

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Dear President Obama,


&gt; Congratulations on winning the election for president of the United
&gt; States of America. I was so happy that history was made. Not so many times you wake up with an African-American president. My family,
&gt; friends and teachers were so happy and my principal cried.


&gt; President Obama, you encourage me and all of America to follow their 
&gt; dreams. We could be anything. You opened a door to everyone.


&gt; President Obama, may you please try to come up with new ways to help homeless people? I wish you and your family lots and lots of luck. I 
&gt; promise to follow you and Joe Biden's rules.


&gt; Thank you for listening to me. We trust you as president. President

Context:

From his careful body maintenance to his mental preparation -- and even to his fashion choices -- the NBA's betting favorite to win MVP approaches his day with meticulous care. Indeed, every minute of Antetokounmpo's game-day routine -- which begins six hours before tipoff -- is scripted.

Antetokounmpo's eccentricities are a matter of efficiency, not superstition. Like Barack Obama and Steve Jobs before him, the 24-year-old All-Star aims to eliminate all unnecessary decisions and distractions. Instead of a blue suit or a black turtleneck, Antetokounmpo favors Nike Tech Fleece sweatsuits and has no interest in joining the NBA's nightly pregame fashion shows.

""I just want to win,"" Antetokounmpo says. ""All that other stuff takes away from the game, and you just spend extra energy on looking good for five seconds. I don't care about that. I just want to look good on the court. Get the win and go back home and lay on my couch and just watch game film. That's it.""

Both of these guys obviously can score ,but the way they score is very similar both use smooth crossovers into stepbacks and either shoot or if they don’t get space blow by you for the dunk ,Now Beal is a little better at playmaking and PG is a little better at defense ,but I really think they are closer to each other in those respects than people might think,Pg isn’t as good of a playmaker but he has learned how to be less of a ball stopper as his career has gone on and keep the offense flowing.Brad Beal isn’t as good a defender as PG but he plays the most minutes and covers the most distance in the league while being probably the most consistent defender on his team.

I don't blame them for us missing the playoffs. That's on us for losing so many close games and a few we should have won. Also the slump after the All Star break was sad, considering it was in Charlotte so you'd think it would be a positive experience on the season. We should have easily made it.

544,"Almost 15 years passed between Jamal Crawford's first 50 point performance and his record-breaking performance last night. Here is an incomplete list of things that have happened in the meantime.
Crawford scored 50 points on April 11 2004. Almost 15 years later, he got 51 and became the oldest every to score more than 50, breaking Michael Jordan's record from 2001. This is a (very) incomplete list of things that have happened between those two performances:

- Eight different teams have won the NBA Championship (Pistons, Spurs, Heat, Celtics, Lakers, Mavericks, Warriors &amp; Cavaliers).
- Ten different players have been named NBA MVP (Garnett, Nash, Nowitzki, Kobe, LeBron, Rose, Durant, Curry, Westbrook &amp; Harden).
- 840 players were selected in the NBA Draft. 726 of them made at least one NBA appearance.
- 47 different players have scored at least 50 points in a game.

- The United States elects it's first African American President.
- The US and Cuba take up diplomatic relations for the first time since 1961.


- Serbia &amp; Montenegro split up into two new countries after a referendum in Montenegro.
- Kosovo declares it's independence from Serbia.
- South Sudan claims independence from Sudan. 


- Pope John Paul II dies, and Pope Benedict XVI is elected pope.
- Pope Benedict XVI resigns, and Pope Francis is elected pope.
- Africa sees it's first female head of state, with Ellen Johnson Sirleaf taking office in Liberia.
- Saddam Hussein is executed.
- The most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression hits. 
- The European Union gets ten new member states with the 2004 enlargement. Later Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia also join.
- The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union.
- Scotland votes for independence in a referendum.
- Boko Haram begin their rebellion in Nigeria.
- The Iraq War comes to an end.
- Osama bin Laden is killed.


- The iPhone is launched, and later the iPad is also introduced.
- YouTube is founded.
- Twitter is founded.
- Instagram is founded.
- The Higgs boson is discovered.
- Liquid water is found on Mars.

So to sum up ... Jamal Crawford is really old and an incredible baller!

548,"The Houston Heist - Starring the Denver Nuggets, Portland Trail Blazers, with a cameo from the Oklahoma City Thunder
What we are witnessing here this week, is a daylight robbery of the Houston Rockets. The Rockets *should* have been able to finish 2nd overall in the conference, they certainly played like it, but other teams had other plans. Namely, the Denver Nuggets and the Portland Trail Blazers

These are the 3rd and 4th best teams in the West, and they recognize that. Fortunately for them, the Rockets infamously started off 11-14 and had to play catch up. Now both the Nuggets and the Blazers did not want to play the Rockets in the second round, in order to ensure the easiest path to the WCF. It was an unlikely plan, many even questioned if the risk was worth the reward, but these two teams set the plan in motion, and it is 24 hours away from being complete.

What did they do? Both the Rockets and the Trail Blazers were hot on Denver's tails, and it was clearly that the seeding would go down to the last two days of the season. Unfortunately, Jusuf Nurkic went down with a season-ending injury, and his team needed help in getting into the top 3. The Nuggets and Trail Blazers played each other twice in the final stretch, with these games having big seeding implications. The Nuggets knew that Portland was very close to Houston, and they owned the tiebreaker. So what did they do? They intentionally let Portland win a game in order to let them gain ground on the Rockets and take the 3rd seed.

Nuggets knew the risk, Houston gets closer to them, and if they lose another game, they may very well hand the 2nd seed, and home-court advantage, to the Rockets, and have to play a hot, hot Houston team that just doesn't match up with them. By letting Portland win, Denver set the plan in motion.

What needed to happen was that Denver had to win one more game, while Portland had to win their last two. But the tricky part was Houston seemingly being unbeatable. All eyes were on their season finale; on the road, playing the Oklahoma City Thunder.

If all 3 teams did their part, they could overthrow the Rockets, and force them to play the Warriors in one half of the bracket, leaving the other half wide open. Late on Tuesday, it seemed like the plan was failing. Denver lost to Utah, Portland was losing to the South Bay Lakers, and the Rockets held a double digit lead over the Thunder in the 4th quarter. 

It seemed like Denver had lost the 2nd seed, and Portland was locked into 4th. But two heros rose up to the occasion, and delivered the first punch.

Amidst a huge 4th quarter comeback including 7 straight points from Westbrook, Paul George nailed the game winning corner 3. This checked off one of the boxes. Next it was up to the Blazers to deliver on what should have been an easy win. But no, Alex Caruso would not let that happen.

He gave a fight. A strong showing from him, and his team, but Portland knew what was at stake. They couldn't let this game slip away. Moe Harkless couldn't let this game slip away, as he nailed the game-winning, buzzer-beating, corner 3 to cap off a 12 point run by himself. The second step was done, and Houston was devastated. They were watching the 2nd seed slip away from them, and they couldn't do anything about it.

Now, with everything set to banish Houston to the Golden State bracket, we head into finale night, where Denver and Portland can seal the deal. Both playing non-playoff teams, but talented teams nonetheless. If they can pull this off, Houston will officially finish 4th, and the heist will be complete. Tune in tomorrow to see what happens.",nba

555,"So this whole time there was no secret plan when it came to the Lakers offseason roster signings
This whole time since the offseason I thought there was something I was missing or that the Lakers were going to establish some kind of new system around Lebron. It turns out the Rondo/Beasley/Stephenson signings were really just awful contracts given out because Magic/Pelinka had heard their names before and hadn’t actually watched them play basketball in years. There was no new system getting introduced, Walton really was just that bad at leading a team. 

And this whole time Lebron was getting heat for not slapping ass holes with his 20 year old roommates in the locker room. Maginka actually thought the trades they were making like giving up Zubac for nothing were good moves. If I’m Lebron I fully entertain the idea of demanding a trade this offseason.

Intentionally loss to Blazers. Gambled everything that OKC would win against Houston. Blazers just won against Lakers. If Denver win against TWolves and Blazers got a W against Kings tomorrow, Denver will get the 2nd seed and HCA against 3rd seed Blazers. Now, remember Denver is 3-1 against Blazers, 2-2 against potential 7th seed Spurs and swept potential 6th seed OKC. Also, they straight up force a 2nd round matchup GSW and Rockets with this. 64D chess at its BEST!

Now Rockets' fans hope is put all on the TWolves and the Kings. How's it gonna end? Find out tomorrow",nba

* If OKC loses and the Clippers/Spurs win, OKC would fall to No. 8 seed
* With their season, Bucks have championship aspirations

* Bucks will have at least 2 days off after tonight anyway

632,"Is Kevvin Wayne Durant the most COMPLETE player of all time?
I think he might. Look at all the all-time greats. Even the greatest of the greatest had some weaknesses.

1. Jordan - deep shooting. He was not elite from the 3-point line. Take out the years when the 3-point line was moved forward and he is a career 31% 3FG. Jordan could also not guard the power positions (Center, Power Forward).

2. Kareem - ball handling. Deep shooting. Guarding smaller players on a switch.

3. Russell - offensive ability, shooting.

4. Magic - shooting of the dribble. Defense.

5. Bird - Guarding smaller and quicker players on the perimeter. Overall athleticism.

6. Wilt - shooting

7. Kobe - deep shooting. Balancing play making and scoring. Shot selection.

8. Shaq - Free throws. Shooting. Guarding smaller players on the perimeter.

9. Lebron - Free throws. Mid range jumper. Off ball ability.

10. Giannis - shooting anywhere beyond 3 feet. Perimeter defense against smaller players.

Now lets look at KD. KD has no glaring weaknesses. It is truly amazing. In OKC he did have weakness. But he basically got rid of all of them in Golden State.

1. Elite 3 point shooter

2. Elite Mid range shooter

3. Elite creating his own shot

4. Elite at the free throw line

5. Elite drawing fouls

6. Elite at the rim ( 75.2% FG )

7. Elite off the ball

8. Elite passing and playmaking ( 6 assists per game )

9. Elite rebounding

10. Elite rim protection ( averaging 1.5 blocks per game in GSW, same as Giannis)

11. Elite defending smaller players ( started playoff games on Harden, Holiday, ect)

12. Elite versatility ( Guard all 5 positions)

13. Elite length and height

14. Elite athletic ability

15. Elite durability

16. Elite unselfishness (taking less shots per game then Klay or Curry)

17. Elite in the clutch (Never been swept)

18. Elite at taking and making big shots (2 Finals Daggers)

19. Elite in isolation scoring

20. Elite in transition

Basically this guy has zero weaknesses. He can do it all. He is a deadly scorer every where on the court. He is a great passer who can easily look over smaller defenders. He is great off ball. He is a great rebounder for his position. He is ultra clutch and can create his own shot at will. He also can grind it out by drawing fouls and hitting those free throws at nearly 90%. 

On defense he is the most versatile defender in the league. Unlike Giannis he is quick enough to guard elite PG's and Wings. He is strong enough and long enough to guard Center's and is an elite rim protector. His length allows him to close out masterfully on shooters.

Dude is literally the perfect basketball player with no weaknesses.",nba

They can finish 2, 3, or 4. If Denver loses to Minnesota, they're 2; if both Denver and Portland win, they're 4. Otherwise, they're 3.

4 plays Utah, who's locked into the fifth seed. 2 or 3 could play the Thunder, the Clippers, or the Spurs (the Thunder can't fall below the 7th seed).

I'm not sure who Houston would most want to play in the first round, but it's really the second round I'm thinking about. The 4 seed puts them against the Warriors earlier, when Chris Paul will have less wear and tear on his body. Also, perhaps the Warriors are still trying to find playoff rhythm with Cousins then.

This is far to complicated for me to do on mobile so it's been neglected a bit... my bad on that.

&amp;nbsp;


The Trail Blazers have the belt right now and they can take it into the post season if they beat The Kings.  This game may actually mean something to them as beating The Kings gives them a tie record with The Rockets.  The Blazers won the head to head match up this year (2-1) so they would move up to the 3rd seed. That would change their match up from the Jazz to one of  the three teams at the bottom of the pile.

&amp;nbsp;

The teams are currently as follows

OKC 48-33

SAS 47-34

LAC 47-34

All teams have clinched so they're playing for seeding.  The Spurs have the tie breaker over The Clips and The Thunder.  The Clips have the tie breaker over The Thunder.  

&amp;nbsp;

That means that the last 3 teams have no idea where they will be seeded.  OKC (@MIL) plays at 8 ET as do The Spurs (@DAL).  Neither of those teams have anything left to play for.  MIL has the overall 1 locked up and DAL is done for the season and will probably just get Dirk some touches.  The Clips play the Jazz who can't move up or down so they'll likely be resting players.  If OKC does lose they will likely drop at least one spot.  The Clips should win as they won't be resting players because you'd crazy not to want to avoid the Warriors in the first round, even if it's a long shot.  The Clips play at 10:30 so they'll know if they need to give a shit about this game either before tip or by the end of the first quarter (unless OKC somehow gets caught in OT).

* All NBA First, Second and Third Team

**Question: Why Should You Help?**   
**Answer: I did this in 2017 successfully**

I'm a Rockets fan who just wants to know the result of the MVP race.

In 2017 I felt the same way and it led me to track the MVP award and [determine Russell Westbrook's MVP victory over James Harden](https://www.thedreamshake.com/2017/5/19/15660904/russell-westbrook-nba-mvp-james-harden-voting-totals) nearly six weeks before the NBA Awards. Thanks to lots of folks on the Internet (perhaps some of you reading this now) I aggregated 72 of the 100 NBA first place MVP votes. All the data gathered for votes 1 through 5 had a 96.5% accuracy rate. Then we ran lots of simulations for the missing data to  affirm the Westbrook victory.

Here on Reddit I have a small annual tradition of trying to predict the NBA MVP voters before the All-Star Game. I've done this prediction in both [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/7qudse/oc_there_are_10_nba_mvp_votes_up_for_grabs/) and [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/aj51ns/at_least_17_nba_mvp_votes_will_change_hands_in/).

I know other folks on Reddit are starting to gather votes and I think that's great. The playoffs were better when the NBA was giving out awards mid-series. It stoked rivalries and created more narratives. Jordan vs. Malone. Olajuwon vs. Robinson. Magic vs. Bird. 

It doesn't make any sense to wait two months to give out these awards... especially when the NBA has acknowledged there are financial implications attached to them and now announce the All-NBA Teams ASAP.

I'm a big fan of crowdsourcing and will include the Reddit or Twitter handle of anyone who contributes in the spreadsheet. I'll post updates here on r/nba every few days of what's changed and when there's enough votes gathered I'll have a friend run 10,000 simulations on each award to make a projection of the winners.

&amp;#x200B;

**How Do We Determine The Voters?:**

Since the NBA announced new transparency rules in 2017 for awards ballots the media vote for the All-Star Starters has been largely predictive of the NBA MVP vote:

In 2017: 94.7% of the All-Star media voters also voted for NBA MVP at the end of the year.

In 2018: 93% of the All-Star media voters also voted for NBA MVP at the end of the year.

This is important because it's not exact that everyone who votes for All-Star also votes for MVP. It's not huge, but a change of 5-7 voters should be expected. 

Also: Between the 2018 MVP award and the 2019 All-Star Game the NBA swapped 36 of the 100 total voters. The highest turnover rate since they brought the pool down to 100 voters. Lots of those make sense. Some of them don't. For example the NBA nearly wholesaled the 10 international voters from 2018 MVP to 2019 All-Star. Only one international voter stayed the same. Some of those voters left their past jobs, but even the ones who stayed at the same publication were not given votes in All-Star this year. There's no certainty that they won't bring some of those folks back.

What about David Aldridge? The Hall of Fame reporter has had an MVP vote forever. In 2018 he left TNT and became the editor-in-chief of The Athletic DC. This year he did not have an All-Star Starters vote. But I won't believe David Aldridge doesn't have an MVP vote until I see the lists.

In the spreadsheet the voters are divided into three categories. National media. International media. Local voters: these are identified by the team/market they represent. The NBA hasn't put it in writing, but stories on MVP voting have indicated that the NBA wants there to be one voter for every market. Currently Houston is missing a voter and Atlanta does not have a Hawks beat writer. Though the argument could be made that anyone at Turner represents the Atlanta market.

 

**My Standards:**

I strive to be objective in my determination of how someone is voting or has voted. Despite my Beard-loving ways. Here's what I try to do:

* A voter needs to say or write with authority how they are voting or declare with zero ambiguity who their MVP is. In 2017 Kevin Harlan gave an interview on Houston radio during the playoffs so heavy with praise for James Harden he probably sprouted a beard during the interview. The radio station was adamant in a back-and-forth with me on Twitter that Harlan had voted for Harden... Nope. He had voted Westbrook, but wanted to avoid alienating the local market which still needed to tune in to TNT.
* Also, there's a difference between someone saying ""I think Giannis will win the award"" and ""Giannis is my pick for MVP."" ESPN's Tim MacMahon is a great example of this in the [ESPN 5 on 5](http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/26415151/nba-mvp-debate-how-decide-giannis-harden). I see a few folks counting him as a Giannis vote, I haven't seen that. I could have missed it somewhere, but it's not in that ESPN article. And it doesn't seem likely to me the Dallas-based ESPN reporter who spends a significant amount of time with the Rockets would declare a vote for anyone but Harden publicly now. Unless the belief is any attention is good attention. Or you wanted to strain your relationship with a team you have a relationship with just for fun.
* I want voters to say they have a ballot. But I will include their vote right now if they had an MVP vote last year. With the NBA already swapping out more than one-third of the voters from last year it seems unlikely they'd be pulling ballots from those who voted for MVP last year and for All-Star this year. Perhaps this belief is flawed.
* I track how many consecutive years a voter has voted and include that in a column if I don't have
* If someone voted in the 2019 All-Star, but not for the 2018 MVP Award, then I will not include them unless I have a source for them having a ballot.
* I include a source link to where a voter or prospective voter has said how they voted. And I include a source link to where they say they have a ballot, if they do.

This all said. I welcome your help and will strive to recognize anyone who shares information that makes it to the spreadsheet.",nba
730,"If the Lakers had pulled off a mid-season trade for AD and made the playoffs
Do you think Magic still would have resigned? Was he gonna quit no matter what or do you think he only left because the going got tough and the team’s offseason outlook was murky?",nba
731,"This isn’t Magic Johnson’s first change of heart: he attempted (and gave up) two separate comebacks as a player as well as a short stint as a coach
As you know, Magic Johnson retired early after contracting HIV. However, younger fans may not remember what happened next.

His first retirement came in the preseason of the 1991-92 season, immediately after that diagnosis. He was so popular that he was voted into the All-Star game anyway despite not playing that year. The league let him play, and he went on to win the All-Star MVP!

Despite not playing other than that one game, Johnson also participated in the original 1992 “Dream Team” that won the gold medal.

After that experience, Johnson attempted to come back as a player (for the ’92-93 season.) He struggled during the preseason, and decided to give it up and retire again before the season started.

Johnson stayed close to the Lakers organization in an informal role. That next season (‘93-94), the Lakers struggled on the court (with a 28-38 record) and turned to Johnson for help. In fact, they named him the head coach. Johnson started strong (5-1), then stumbled to an 0-10 finish. He stepped away afterwards, stating that his heart was not in coaching after all. 

The following season (‘94-95), Johnson felt the itch to play again. He got in better shape this time around, and played well (averaging 14 points, 6 rebound, 7 assists) in the 30 games he was healthy enough to suit up. However, the Lakers were pretty good at this point and trying to work in the older Johnson created some friction. After debating going to another team, he decided to retire for good.

What’s the **morale of the story** here? It’s not that Magic Johnson is a “quitter.” It’s actually a good quality to know what you can and can’t do well and adjust accordingly. But for a player like Johnson who was so beloved and praised during his career, those struggles and subsequent criticism must be especially difficult and jarring. And when something doesn’t feel right to him or things aren’t going according to plan, he’s had a history of stepping away.",nba

746,"Let’s credit Sam Presti for taking risks in the 2017 offseason that drastically changed the course of so much NBA
In the Thunder’s 2017 offseason, 2 events occurred. They traded Oladipo and Sabine’s for PG13 and traded Kanter and McDermott for Melo. At the time, people heralded the team as the Big 3 (or OK3) and some even gave them a legitimate shot at besting the Warriors. While they haven’t quite accomplished their goals yet, it is important to note just how much this trade affected the NBA.

The most significant development works at the detriment to the Lakers. If PG stays in Indiana, he probably leaves after the season to join forces with LeBron in LA. At that point, it was almost an afterthought. Resigning with OKC caught everyone by surprise (although LeBron probably the most) and left the Lakers scrambling in free agency. We now see what happened when the Lakers tried to execute their backup plan.

The next significant development is the rise to stardom of Oladipo and legitimacy of Sabonis. The Oladipo story speaks for itself. The man went from unplayable in the playoffs to an All-Star candidate. He’s a player no one would have expected to emerge as a leader, yet he has truly risen to the occasion. While in Indiana, he’s also gotten the chance to record a pretty good R&amp;B album as well, putting him in the ranks of Damian Lillard in terms of NBA player-musicians. Sabonis’ story is interesting because he was supposed to be the backup and clear #2 to Myles Turner. Sabonis has shown legitimate skill and has challenged Turner for the past 2 years to be a better player. Some could argue the Pacers are in a much better place than when they had Paul George.

One final development is the absolute murder of Carmelo’s career. His final years with the Knicks, we wrote him off as his old self. Only when he was on a relevant team did he get absolutely exposed as a player. Melo’s decline was one of the harsher career falls in recent NBA history.

Without that trade, we could be looking at a LeBron-PG combo in the playoffs right now. We could be looking at a Pacers team fighting for relevancy as they scour the lottery. I’m unsure on Melo, as his career seems to be in the tank. OKC could be struggling to continue their relative team success as well. We have to credit those 2 moves for the current NBA.",nba

Yes, yes, I know it's sacrilegious to talk about both of these guys in the same thread, but these legends are retiring and we should be happy to have seen them play! Anyway, I had to get my thoughts out after last night, and made this comment below:

Man, sports are weird.

I’m up at 5:30 in the morning, having seen my favorite basketball player, Dirk Nowitzki, announce his retirement last night. It still seems surreal to me because really with this, I feel like a chapter of my life is coming to a close. I’ve been watching this guy swish jumpers since I was 13 years old, and like, I could always look forward to that whenever the basketball season rolled around. Why did I get so invested into this guy and his team when I was a brown kid, living back in Queens?

I guess for me, basketball was initially a way for me to bond with my dad. See, after he would come home from his tiring day job, he would plop down on the couch and look for something to watch on the TV. Every now and then he would stop flicking through the channels and land on a basketball game. It’s funny though, my earliest memory of watching ball with my dad is actually about the Philadelphia 76ers, and seeing a graphic of how banged up Allen Iverson was when he was playing. As a fairly sheltered kid, my only notion of pain was dealing with papercuts and ripped pages while doing homework. My parents never thought of putting me in sports, as it was that immigrant mentality to always have me focus on academia, but that is a rant for another time. Anyway, we would always marvel at the skill, hustle, and heart that was shown by these players. They possessed something that I would never have, a preternatural amount of physical ability. One player catching fire, playing beyond his abilities for a portion of the game, or making all the right choices, could make all the difference. 

So this goes on for a couple of years until I guess, 2006, when I think was the first time I think I remember Dirk. He was in the NBA Finals with his team, the Dallas Mavericks, and my dad and I were watching them battle Dwyane Wade and the Miami Heat. I couldn’t get my eyes of this 7 ft. tall, lanky, white dude who was putting the ball in the hoop at will. He wasn’t using his athletic chops to accomplish it (although he was quite quick and explosive), just his amazing shot. In the end, through a lot of controversy, they ended up losing in 6 games, but man, I was hooked. The next year, I followed most of the Mavs games that were on national television, reveling in each win and just being blah about the losses. They ended the season with a 67- 15 record, one of the best of all time, and I was like yooooo they got this! Dirk also won the MVP that year and I was like that’s my guy. They were beat in the first round by the only team that had their number all season. I was crushed. In school, (mind you these were during my emotional teenage years haha), I would overhear that Dirk was soft and he could never close the deal, etc. Now these things shouldn’t have bothered me because you know, basketball is just a game right. Except now I’m emotionally invested in this team and apparently my mental state is loosely tied with how they’re performing haha.

The next few years are disappointments in terms of their playoff performances but man, it was always good to be able to just stream a basketball game on the internet while just doing homework. It was a good distraction from life back in school and back at home. Eventually 2011 rolls around, and there are a couple of new faces on the team. As the season rolls on, I’m like damn, this team is really clicking! But I was afraid of getting my hopes up as the Mavs were quite good at dashing them, no matter how good they seemed lol. First round they win in 6 games, after a crazy game 4 comeback win by their first round opponents, the Blazers. After that game, critics and everyone was calling them soft again, but I believed. What choice did I have? Round 2, they SWEPT THE LAKERS, THE TWO TIME DEFENDING CHAMPS! Do you know how crazy that is??? I have a fond memory of my cousins, my brother and my dad just watching the game from my bedroom and being flabbergasted on how the Mavericks were just destroying the Lakers. Not just Dirk, but the entire team around him was playing great. See, they were always out of sync years prior, where one would be playing at or exceeding expectations while they other was lacking. Anyway, I’m sure my cousins noticed the huge grin on my face in the massacre that was game 4. On to the next round, they played the OKC Thunder, and let me tell you guys, Dirk went off. My all time favorite shot by him is in this series (https://youtu.be/dOZZbYtYZJA?t=191). Look at how he just contorts his body and the ball hits nothing but net! There were definitely some special performances by him that series and maaaaaaaaaan I could feel it in the air. I think it was then when I knew that I was completely in. Finally the NBA Finals came around again, and it was Dirk and the Mavs against the team that had beat them 5 years ago, the Miami Heat. Except this time they had a few new players, I think you might know them as Chris ‘I’m not a dinosaur’ Bosh and Lebron ‘Not 1, not 2, not 3…’ James. The first game was… depressing to say the least. I think the Mavs lost by like 10 or 20? My guys looked slow out there. The second game started off similar, by the end of the 3rd quarter they were down by 15 and the festivities had all but begun in Miami. I was gutted. Why did I care? Does it matter? All I know was that I did. I just finished my freshman year in college and was working in one of the labs as an intern and everything was stressful and nothing made sense and this was one of the only things that brought me joy and even now it leads to despair. But something happened, and Dirk and the Mavs came back to win the game on a close buzzer beater. I was shocked, but I didn’t let it get to me, because this was the Mavs we were talking about. A bunch of chokers. Game 3 they barely lost in the end and I was like yup, they are who we they they were. I prayed and prayed that they could get over the hump and beat the Heat (As in I actually prayed, like a Muslim would lol). I guess the Mavs head coach, Rick Carlisle, got some inspiration from me though, made some lineup changes for Game 4, and the rest was history. Mavs win in 6, and I reach the absolute peak as a sports fan. (Also Dirk made this shot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmd7ljeYcA which is absolutely bonkers too).

Alas, the next couple of years, injuries piled up, the front office couldn’t get another good team around him and they sorta faded back into the pack. I still watched almost every game I could though, and there are definitely memorable moments to look back to (which I will be sharing as the days, weeks go by). I even got to see Dirk and the Mavs in person with my dad and my brother! Anyway, the entire point of this weird oral history was to dictate how intertwined this stupid sport of basketball and Dirk got with my life. He was a fixture in my consciousness ever since I was 13 years old, and now that I’m 26, he won’t be there anymore. That’s literally half of my life. He showed me that putting the work in will show results, no matter how much time it takes (seriously, just look up vids of this guy practicing alone in the gym for hours with his crazy mentor). The team, and watching basketball in general, was always there for me when I needed it, and now the one common fixture of my fanhood is riding off into the sunset. He deserves it, after all of the ups and downs he brought to the fans around the world. I don’t know if I will be as invested in the team next year, but his self-deprecating humor and humility and work-ethic were something that will always stick with me. I might add some more thoughts later, but I want to sign of with, thank you Dirk.",nba

I think LA will treat his retirement tour as appreciation for LeBron the player and LeBron the historically significant figure in NBA history. But I don’t think he will be appreciated as the man and as the legend like he would in Cleveland. That’s no fault of LA, it’s just the connection will always be different. 

To be honest, it makes me a little sad to think of him retiring elsewhere. Obviously that’s partly because I’m a Clevelander, but also because he deserves to have him moment just like Kobe, Dirk, and Wade did and he just won’t have that level of a moment being anywhere but Cleveland.",nba

35,"[OC] Why a ""665/8"" slash line is the magic number for draft-eligible HBs
So far this year, I’ve made a few magic number posts. It started with [this one looking at QBs having bad games against unranked opponents](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b5oq1g/oc_how_concerning_is_it_if_a_qb_has_a_bad_game_in/?st=jtxtj9fu&amp;sh=473fcea0) and how those QBs don’t work out. Then, we took a look at [wide receivers who fell below a certain slash line in college](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b8i76d/oc_why_a_9941_reception_slash_line_is_the_magic/?st=juagp583&amp;sh=c859a205), and how those guys panned out.

Today, for the first time ever, we’re taking a look at halfbacks. The guys that run with the football are going to be under the microscope today.

There’s a bunch of halfbacks that get drafted every year. Last year, there were 20 halfbacks that were chosen, and that doesn’t even include Philip Lindsay, who was an UDFA out of Colorado State that may have been the best rookie HB in the NFL not named Saquon Barkley. At least 20 halfbacks have been taken in each of the last six drafts; on average, a team will draft a halfback once every two years.

With that many halfback prospects out there, is there any way we can tell whether or not a halfback is going to bust and not do anything? Let’s look at the magic number to determine halfback success in the NFL.

**Part I: The Formula**

Because I don’t need game logs for this one, I decided to go back further than 2000. For this one, I looked at every HB to get drafted since the 1996 NFL Draft. This is a sample size spanning over two decades. Some say you can’t evaluate a draft class until a player’s rookie contract expires (so four years in today’s NFL). Seeing as every rookie from 2015 (excluding fifth year options being used) now has had their contract expire, this gives us a nice, even 20 drafts to look at from that perspective.

Much like the wide receiver post, this is two magic numbers, and not just one. **The magic number slash line in 665/8.** What does this slash line mean? It only looks at what a player did in their final season in college. **If, in their final season, a halfback had 665 rushing yards or less AND had 8 rushing touchdowns or less, they were placed on the list.** This is a two-parter to indicate how good a halfback was in their final season at accumulating rushing yards, and how good a halfback was in their final season at finding the end zone. If a halfback met one of the criteria, they were excluded; they had to meet both. A halfback that only had 500 rushing yards but was a touchdown machine and scored 12 rushing touchdowns does not count; likewise, a halfback that only had 5 rushing touchdowns but had 1,100 rushing yards does not count.

Having said that, there are a few qualifications for this magic number:

- The player in question had to be a halfback and, if they played in the NFL, play halfback. There were certain guys that qualified for the list, such as Rock Cartwright and Detron Smith, but played fullback in the NFL. They don’t count; they’re not supposed to be yardage guys or touchdown guys. They’re blockers. 

- They had to be listed as a halfback in their final season of college. Quarterbacks and wide receivers don’t count. They had to be a halfback.

- I only looked at halfbacks that played Division I football in FBS or I-A. As you go further back, FCS and I-AA stats, and Division II and Division III stats get really spotty and are often inaccurate. Fortunately, this isn’t the case for FBS stats, since College Reference is a godsend for things like these.

- The halfback in question had to play at least four games. I’m not going to punish a guy for being injured and not being able to play. As an example, in 1994, Curtis Martin had a 251-yard game against Texas in the opener, but then suffered a sprained ankle in his second game and missed the rest of the season. He finished the season with 282 yards and a touchdown having played 2 games; today, he is a Hall of Fame halfback widely regarded as one of the top 10 halfbacks of all-time. To punish guys like that would be absurd.

- And finally, the halfback in question had to be the only halfback that got drafted that year from that school. This is an acknowledgement that there are times where a school has two really good halfbacks, and that numbers might decline for one or both of them if they’re splitting carries. As an example, Kenyan Drake qualifies for this list as a third round pick; however, he was on the same Alabama team that had Derrick Henry as a second round pick. Punishing Drake for not putting up the best numbers when he was splitting reps with a Heisman-winning HB wouldn’t be right.

One final point before I give the list (which includes over 40 halfbacks). One of the most common criticisms I get on these posts is that “a lot of these guys are sixth and seventh rounders anyways and weren’t expected to contribute.” That’s fair- a good chunk of sixth and seventh round picks don’t pan out, and don’t even make the 53-man roster. However, draft picks, no matter the round, are still valuable. If you can limit the risk of a player not working out, then why wouldn’t you do that? Additionally, there are multiple third and fourth round picks on this list (and a second round pick), which are rounds where contributions are still expected out of picks, so it’s not as though this list is just being occupied by players expected to be at the bottom of the barrel.

With all of that being said, which halfbacks fits this criteria?

**Part II: The Historic List**

Much like the wide receiver list, this one is a really long list as well. There’s over 40 halfbacks drafted since 1996 that fit this magic number. All of these players, in their final season of college, had 665 rushing yards or less, and had 8 rushing touchdowns or less. Note that if a HB from 2017 or 2018 is on the list, I’m only going to say that player is a bust if that player is no longer on the team, since otherwise, there’s still time to turn it around. So let’s take a look at this disappointing list.

Year | HB | School | Rushing Yards in Final Season | Rushing TDs in Final Season | Draft | Notes
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2018 | Mark Walton | Miami (FL) | 428 | 3 | R4, P112- Cincinnati | Had 34 rushing yards for the Bengals this year, finishing his Cincinnati career with more arrests (3) than yards per carry (2.4). He was just cut last week
2018 | David Williams | Arkansas | 656 | 8 | R7, P226- Denver | Never played a snap for the Broncos. Currently with the Jaguars
2018 | Bo Scarborough | Alabama | 596 | 8 | R7, P236- Dallas | Never played a snap for the Cowboys. Currently with the Seahawks
2017 | TJ Logan | UNC | 650 | 7 | R5, P179- Arizona | Has recorded 2 rushes for 2 yards in his NFL career so far
2016 | Daniel Lasco | California | 331 | 3 | R7, P237- New Orleans | Had 32 rushing yards for the Saints in his career
2016 | Dwayne Washington | Washington | 282 | 4 | R7, P236- Detroit | Had 309 rushing yards on 2.8 yards per carry for the Lions
2016 | Keith Marshall | Georgia | 350 | 3 | R7, P242- Washington | Never played a snap in the NFL
2016 | Zac Brooks | Clemson | 242 | 3 | R7, P247- Seattle | Never played a snap in the NFL
2015 | Kenny Hilliard | LSU | 447 | 6 | R7, P235- Houston | Never played a snap in the NFL
2014 | Dri Archer | Kent State | 527 | 6 | R3, P97- Pittsburgh | Was supposed to be a HB/WR hybrid for the Steelers. Ended up finishing with 63 yards from scrimmage in his career
2014 | De’Anthony Thomas | Oregon | 594 | 8 | R4, P124- Kansas City | Much like Archer, was supposed to be a HB/WR hybrid for the Chiefs. In five seasons, he has 689 yards from scrimmage, and his best season from a scrimmage standpoint was just 269 yards
2013 | Knile Davis | Arkansas | 377 | 2 | R3, P96- Kansas City | Finished his time with the Chiefs with 800 rushing yards on 3.3 yards per carry
2013 | Spencer Ware | LSU | 367 | 1 | R6, P194- Seattle | Did absolutely nothing with the Seahawks, finishing his time in Seattle with 10 rushing yards. In fairness to Ware, he found some success with the Chiefs, rushing for 1,570 yards in his time there
2012 | Edwin Baker | Michigan State | 665 | 5 | R7, P250- San Diego Chargers | Did not record a rushing attempt with the Chargers. Finished his NFL career with 173 rushing yards
2010 | Charles Scott | LSU | 542 | 4 | R6, P200- Philadelphia | Never played a snap in the NFL
2009 | Mike Goodson | Texas A&amp;M | 406 | 5 | R4, P111- Carolina | Ran for 501 yards with the Panthers in his three seasons there. Finished his NFL career with 783 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns
2009 | Aaron Brown | TCU | 547 | 3 | R6, P192- Detroit | Ran for 189 yards with the Lions in his career, never recording a rushing touchdown
2009 | Chris Ogbonnaya | Texas | 373 | 4 | R7, P211- St. Louis Rams | Ran for 50 yards with the Rams. After bouncing around the league, finished his career with 710 rushing yards
2009 | Fui Vakapuna | BYU | 263 | 3 | R7, P215- Cincinnati | Never played a snap in the NFL
2008 | Ryan Torain | Arizona State | 553 | 5 | R5, P139- Denver | Ran for a not-so-nice 69 yards in his career with the Broncos. Had a semi-decent season in 2010 with Washington when he picked up 742 yards on the ground, but that was the only season he had with more than 200 rushing yards. Finished his career with 1,011 rushing yards
2007 | Chris Henry | Arizona | 581 | 7 | R2, P50- Tennessee | One of the biggest busts in the history of the Titans. Ran for 122 yards in his career. Fortunately for them, it didn’t end up mattering much in the long run since the very next year, they spent a first round pick on CJ2K
2007 | Lorenzo Booker | Florida State | 616 | 4 | R3, P71- Miami | Ran for 125 yards with the Dolphins. Finished his career with 230 rushing yards and 0 touchdowns
2007 | Thomas Clayton | Kansas State | 322 | 3 | R6, P186- San Francisco | Never played a snap for the 49ers. Finished his NFL career with 29 rushing yards on 1.9 yards per carry
2006 | Leon Washington | Florida State | 430 | 3 | R4, P117- NY Jets | On special teams, Washington was an absolute stud. He was one of the most dynamic kick returners in NFL history, finishing with 8 kickoff return TDs. The magic number does not account for special teams. As a halfback, he didn’t do a whole lot (2,271 career rushing yards, with 1,782 of them coming with the Jets), but as a return man, he was amazing. This is probably the only good pick on this list
2005 | Lionel Gates | Louisville | 373 | 7 | R7, P236- Buffalo | Never got a carry in the NFL
2003 | Ahmaad Galloway | Alabama | 257 | 4 | R7, P235- Denver | Never played a snap in the NFL

2002 | Jarrett Ferguson | Virginia Tech | 156 | 5 | R7, P251- Buffalo | Never played a snap in the NFL
2001 | George Layne | TCU | 279 | 6 | R4, P108- Kansas City | Never played a snap with the Chiefs. Finished his career with 32 rushing yards and 0 touchdowns
2000 | Rondell Mealey | LSU | 637 | 8 | R7, P252- Green Bay | Finished his career with 73 rushing yards in two seasons with the Packers
1999 | Sean Bennett | Northwestern | 160 | 1 | R4, P112- NY Giants | Ran for 126 yards in his NFL career, all with the Giants
1999 | Charlie Rogers | Georgia Tech | 439 | 3 | R5, P132- Seattle | Predominantly used for special teams, where he recorded 3 touchdowns over his career. Never recorded a carry in the NFL

1998 | Tarik Smith | California | 636 | 7 | R7, P223- Dallas | Never played a snap in the NFL
1998 | Ernest Blackwell | Missouri | 551 | 6 | R7, P224- Kansas City | Never played a snap in the NFL

1996 | Kantroy Barber | West Virginia | 362 | 4 | R4, P124- New England | Never recorded a carry in the NFL. Did not play a snap with the Patriots, appearing in two games with the Dolphins in 1999
1996 | Leon Neal | Washington | 539 | 3 | R6, P196- Buffalo | Never recorded a carry in the NFL. Did not play a snap with the Bills, playing one game with the Colts in 1997
1996 | Ryan Wood | Arizona State | 100 | 2 | R7, P243- Dallas | Never played a snap in the NFL

**Part III: The Analysis**

There’s 41 halfbacks on this list. As a whole, these 41 halfbacks combine for 8,927 rushing yards for their careers. If you combined the rushing yards of all 41 of these guys, they would have fewer rushing yards than 38 other players, including Ahman Green, Shaun Alexander, and Matt Forte. The average halfback on this list will rush for 217 yards in their entire career.

But wait… it gets worse. There are certain players on this list, such as Ryan Torain and Spencer Ware, that got practically all of their yardage with the team that didn’t draft him. If we’re only looking at rushing yards gained with the team that drafted the player, then these halfbacks combined for 4,450 rushing yards. Combined, the number of 41 different halfbacks would rank 173rd in NFL history, behind guys like Donny Anderson, Ted Brown, Marv Hubbard, Otis Armstrong, and Stump Mitchell.

Let’s break these downs even further to show the embarrassment here.

- As mentioned earlier, the average halfback on this list will rush for 217 yards in their entire career. Remember the Chris Johnson game where Gus Johnson famously announced that he had “get away from the cops speed”? He had more rushing yards in that game than the average halfback on this list has in their entire career

- The average halfback on this list will, on average, rush for a mere 108 yards with the team that drafted him. So if you’re a team and you draft a guy that’s on this list that meets this magic number criteria, don’t expect any contributions from that player on your team

- Leon Washington is the only halfback on this list to have more than 800 rushing yards with the team that drafted him (1,782). Of the 41 halfbacks on this list, only 9 of them even had so much as 100+ rushing yards with the team that drafted him

- 20 of the 41 players on this list never recorded a carry in the NFL. If you draft a guy that fits this slash line, there’s a 50% chance that they’ll never so much as touch the ball in a regular season game

- 24 of the 41 players on this list never recorded a carry with the team that drafted him. If, hypothetically, the Texans drafted a guy that met this criteria, and he rushed for 1 yard in his career with the Texans, he’s already in the top half of guys on this list.

- Only 3 halfbacks on this list have accrued 850+ rushing yards in their career. Those guys are Leon Washington, Ryan Torain, and Spencer Ware. While Washington got the bulk of his yards with the Jets, Torain and Ware combined for 79 yards with the teams that drafted them

- If we’re only looking at second and third round picks, that gives us Dri Archer, Spencer Ware, Lorenzo Booker, and Chris Henry. These four halfbacks, taken on what would be day two of the draft in today’s NFL, combined for 1,972 yards in their career. Spencer Ware carries the bulk of that with 1,580 yards, but he only got 10 of those yards with the team that drafted him. Just looking at stats with the team that drafted him, the halfbacks combined for 297 rushing yards, or an average of 74 rushing yards per player. Not sure that’s a good idea to spend a draft pick in the second or third round on a guy that’s going to finish their career with 74 rushing yards for your team over their career

**Part IV: Who to Avoid**

We’ve established the fact that if you draft one of these halfbacks, the odds of them panning out are about as good as the odds of the average person laughing at *Jack and Jill* or *Holmes and Watson.* So which halfbacks at the FBS level meet this criteria? Which halfbacks didn’t have 666+ rushing yards or 9+ rushing touchdowns this past season, and should be avoided because of this?

Remember that I said in my criteria that if two players from the same school get drafted, then I don’t count it. Obviously, the draft hasn’t happened yet, so the best scientific guess I came up with was just looking at the halfbacks invited to the NFL Combine and assuming that any halfbacks invited are getting drafted. If two from the same school went, then they weren’t even looked at with their statistics. In terms of players at the combine, this applied to Alabama (Damien Harris/Josh Jacobs) and Memphis (Darrell Henderson/Tony Pollard); there’s also a few non-combine players that this applied to (such as Florida Atlantic halfback Kerrith Whyte Jr. being excluded from consideration due to Devin Singletary getting an invite). Also, much like the last list, I’m excluding fullbacks, such as Pittsburgh’s George Aston, from the list.

Taj McGowan | UCF | 470 | 8
Jeremy Smith | Louisville | 229 | 0
Keion Davis | Marshall | 408 | 3
Jeremy Cox | Old Dominion | 453 | 5

There’s a lot of halfbacks on this list. I took a look at every halfback on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bu7VCs3ld5efCR3fDjj_vM09KjYbY_SBDkdJHRJPOew/edit?usp=sharing), which if you want to actually watch tape on virtually every prospect in the draft, is a goldmine. There are some guys on this list that have no shot at getting drafted, but there are others, like LJ Scott and Jalin Moore, that are being talked about as good value picks. And, for what it’s worth, for as much of a headcase as LJ Scott is (he’s driven on a suspended license seven times), I do like what I see from him on film (he reminds me a lot of TJ Yeldon). However, the numbers are not in his favor, nor are they in the favor of a lot of other halfbacks that are projected to get drafted, even if it’s only on the third day. Again, this is a list where Ryan Torain is probably the third best halfback on there.

**Part V: Conclusion**

It should go without saying that a halfback who struggles to get yards and struggles to find the end zone should not be drafted. However, as we’ve seen many times over the past quarter century in the NFL, this is not the case. And, virtually all of the time, it does not work out. Can an unproductive college player be successful in the NFL? Judging by this list of 41 halfbacks that have combined for no non-special teams Pro Bowls or All Pros, no 1,000-yard season, and usually average less than 217 rushing yards in their career, the answer seems to be no. Leon Washington is the only player on this list that actually did anything of note with the team that drafted him, and that was because he was a special teams beast (didn’t have a lot to do with his skills as a halfback). If a player falls below both magic numbers, their chances of success in the NFL are not good.

**TL;DR:** Don’t draft HBs who had 665 rushing yards or less in their final season and had 8 rushing touchdowns or less in their final season. They’ll likely be bad.",nfl

66,"What are the most and least talented positional group of players in your team’s division?
I’ll start for the NFC East.

Most talented: Running backs 

Although Guice is still question mark, Adrian Peterson still put up a solid season with a very broken O-line. 

Jordan Howard recently signed with the Eagles and has a top notch season under his belt but also a season where he was not played to his strengths. If Doug Pederson can unlock his potential again, expect Howard  to relieve the Eagles of last season’s running back woes. 

I think Zeke and Barkley’s stats speak for themselves.

Worst: Wide Receivers

Even though Amari Cooper came in and immediately enhanced the Cowboy’s offense tremendously, the cowboys options at wr besides coop range from just “ok” to unproven. The cowboys hope to see Michael Gallup continue his progression and that Randall Cobb and Tavon Austin can stay healthy and improve the offense. But the cowboys passing offense remains a formidable threat with Amari Cooper. 

The Eagles have a receiving core that is solid when healthy, but lack a true star receiver to elevate their offense. But with all that said,  I do expect to see their passing offense improve with the return of djax. It also seems that Eagles may not need a true superstar wide receiver as long as they have Ertz lined up at TE. 

The redskins seems to be at a loss for wide receiver, and will most likely be looking to target a wr early in the draft after the loss of Jamison Crowder (although he did little to truly improve the passing offense). Trey Quinn does appear to be a solid addition to a poor and thin receiving core. 

The Giants are really the team that brought the NFC East’s worst position to wide receiver. After trading OBJ away, the giants expect Shepard to step up and take the WR1 position. The free agent signing of Golden Tate will help, but nothing can truly fill the earth sized hole left by OBJ’s departure.

When NFL prospects attend draft night, it adds an extra point of entertainment to the event. Seeing emotions throughout the night of players getting pick or potentially falling in the draft is great reality television.

When picked, we get to witness them give Roger Goodell an emphatic bro-hug and snap the infamous picture with the commissioner. They then head over for their first taste of a primetime NFL interview.

It’s a great break from endless analysis and projections from analysts to see real, unfiltered emotion.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2010 the NFL Draft moved to primetime. Prior to that, from 2000-2009, an average of six prospects attended the draft. From 2010-on, an average of 23 future NFL players made the trip to accept their team’s pick in person.

&amp;#x200B;

This year, 23 prospects have confirmed the invitation to attend draft night on April 25th.

&amp;#x200B;

But, there’s a certain amount of risk a player must be willing to take when he chooses to attend the event. There’s no guarantee they’ll get taken on the first night, potentially leaving them waiting in the Green Room all night and have to decide whether or not to return to day two and be one of a few players waiting in disappointment for their name to be called.

&amp;#x200B;

Since 2011, no less than four and as many as nine prospects who attended the first day of the draft failed to hear their name called.

Here they are by year and which round they were ultimately picked:

Kris Jenkins blocked the PAT to force OT (which the Panthers ended up winning).  This was a huge play that season and the [only video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QkfzG9T5zY&amp;t=5m33s) online doesn't even show Jenkins.

110,"Besides the Patriots, who has been the most successful team in the 21st century?
Not many choices considering how inconsistent the NFL is; one year a team will look great and the next year shit the bed (Vikings and Jaguars are both examples of this) However there have been some teams that have been successful over a long period of time. The Patriots are an obvious one, there are a few teams that I think fit this thinking

Seahawks-Aside from Holmgren's last season and that season of hell under Jim Mora the Seahawks have had a pretty good run since coming over to the NFC. The Seahawks had a run of 5 straight playoff appearances a few years ago and won a Super Bowl and were an ill-timed pass away from a second. As long as Russell is the qb the Seahawks shall never be counted out

Packers-Probably the most successful team this century besides the Patriots, the Packers have made the playoffs in every season but 5 since 2000, and had an 8 year playoff streak at one point. The Packers have been blessed with 2 HOF QBs the last 2 decades and a half and have a Lombardi Trophy in the last 10 years

Steelers-The Steelers have only had 3 coaches since 1969, which is amazing considering the Browns go through 3 coaches ever 2 years. They have Ben Roethlisberger who helped them win 2 Lombardis and had one of the most stacked teams in football a few years ago",nfl

113,"32 NFL All-Time Teams in 32 Days (Day 18) All-Time Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts
Before I start this post, I want to take note of two things. First things first, I want to mention that I am doing this All-Time Colts write-up even though I already did three other teams before because I thought I found a writer on two different occasions, but they either missed their date for one and couldn't feel their write-up for the other (If you were one the writers that asked for this team originally, I am fine with you). Secondly, the All-Time Jets writer rescheduled on Friday and this post was supposed to come on Friday with the All-Time Packers, so I decided to move this to Wednesday to accommodate for the two writers on Friday. Due to me moving the posting date for today, I couldn't write up a quick summary for the history of the Colts, unfortunately.

**Methodology:**

For the depth charts at each position using a formula that I will call ""[The All-Time Teams Formula](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqtpOiw6hu47-LlZeXlXp_-zDu99ZafGQDwKly8OWFc/edit?usp=sharing)"" The formula only accounts for a player's time with that team. For example, Peyton Manning's score for this Colts team does not include his accolades for the Denver Broncos Secondly, stats didn't play too much of a factor in the way I ranked these players. I prefer Pro Football Reference's AV as a basis rather than stats because of era adjustments like QBs passing the ball a lot more in today's game. I would also like to note that I did not watch every player whether it be in-game or in highlights. This is especially true for those who played pre-1990. I did, however, do a lot of research on many of these guys.

Anyways, onto the All-Time Colts team!

**Coaches (Parenthesis represents years spent with the Colts as a coach of some sort)**

Head Coach: Tony Dungy *(2002-08)*

Offensive Coordinator: Weeb Ewbank *(1954-62)*

Quarterbacks Coach: Ted Marchibroda *(1975-79, 1992-95)*

Running Backs/Wide Receivers Coach: Tom Moore *(1998-2010)*

Defensive Coordinator: Don Shula *(1963-69)*

**QBs**

|1|Peyton Manning *(1998-10)*|328.35|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 1x SB MVP, 4x NFL MVP, 11x Pro Bowler, 1x Offensive POTY, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro, 2x Bert Bell Award, 8x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Johnny Unitas *(1956-72)*|295.6|4 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x SB Champ, 3x NFL MVP, 10x Pro Bowler, 6x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 3x Bert Bell Award, 8x Stat Leader|
|3|Bert Jones *(1973-81)*|109.12|1x NFL MVP, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x Offensive POTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|

The Colts have one of the richest histories when it comes to quarterbacks among the NFL's franchises. The first two quarterbacks to make this team were easy to decide because they have two of the Top 5 quarterbacks in NFL history. In my opinion, **Peyton Manning** and **Johnny Unitas** are the second and fourth greatest quarterbacks in NFL history respectively. Peyton is the greatest statistical quarterback of all-time. He ranks third in completions, second in passing yards, and first in passing TDs among every NFL quarterback in the history of the game and has 5 NFL MVPs throughout his NFL career. Unitas was one of the first great modern NFL quarterbacks in NFL history. He was the first quarterback in NFL history with 30+ passing TDs in a single season. He helped the Baltimore Colts win four NFL championships, and ranks 15th in passing TDs among all quarterbacks who have played in the NFL despite playing in an era that wasn't as pass-happy as the league is today. However, the toughest decision came for the third-string quarterback. I gave **Bert Jones** the nod over Andrew Luck because of his insane three-year peak from 1975 to 1977. He threw 59 touchdown passes to 28 interceptions and the Colts had a 31-11 record in that span. However, he was injured throughout the 1978 and 1979 season and was never the same QB he was in those three years. Also, it's hard for Andrew Luck to make the roster, not because of anti-recency bias, but rather because the three QBs on the all-time team each have at least one NFL MVP.

**RBs**

|1|Lenny Moore *(1956-67)*|172.28|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x NFL MVP, 7x Pro Bowler, 1956 ROTY, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Edgerrin James *(1999-05)*|121.83|4x Pro Bowler, 1999 Offensive ROTY, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x Stat Leader|
|3|Lydell Mitchell *(1972-77)*|90.36|3x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 2x Stat Leader|
|4|Marshall Faulk *(1994-98)*|89.13|3x Pro Bowler, 1994 Offensive ROTY, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|5|Eric Dickerson *(1987-91)*|79.09|3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|6|Tom Matte *(1961-72)*|78.29|3 Championship Games, 1x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|FB1|Alan Ameche (1955-60)|74.6|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 1955 ROTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro, 2x Stat Leader|

The Colts have a lot of great running backs during their time in the NFL. The starting RB spot was difficult for me to decide. **Lenny Moore** was a consistent running back that was very versatile and could make plays in the passing and running game. His stats don't impress you too much but had an amazing season in 1964 when he led the NFL with 20 TDs from scrimmage and won the MVP award that year. **Edgerrin James** was a tremendous player in his prime but was hampered by injuries at times. In his four best seasons with the Colts, he had at least 1,500 rushing yards, including three with more than 2,000 yards from scrimmage. In the end, I gave Moore the nod for the starting running back position because he helped the Colts win 2 NFL Championship while Edge never made it to the big game. The next four running backs were difficult to decide in terms of their order, but Mitchell, Faulk, Dickerson, and Matte were all great running backs during their Colts tenure.

**WRs**

|1|Marvin Harrison *(1996-08)*|190.06|1x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 8x Pro Bowler, 6x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 5x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Raymond Berry *(1955-67)*|150.39|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 6x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro, 8x Stat Leader|
|3|Reggie Wayne *(2001-14)*|139.75|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 6x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|4|T.Y. Hilton *(2012-)*|67.67|4x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Colts are probably the most top-heavy team when it comes to wide receivers with three Top 25 receivers that made this All-Time team. **Marvin Harrison** was Peyton Manning's top target during his NFL career and is a Top 5 receiver of all-time in my book. Harrison caught at least 10 TDs for eight consecutive seasons from 1999-2006. Harrison was about as great a receiver in the 2000s as Randy Moss and Terrell Owens, but he had a totally different personality than the other two previously mentioned receivers. While Owens and Moss were personalities, Harrison was a quiet and hardworking player. For the record, no, I am not taking a shot at today's star receivers. In fact, as a Giants fan, I was quite upset when the Giants traded Odell Beckham, who many say is too much of a diva (not denying the fact that he did have some distractions). End of that story because we're talking about the All-Time Colts receivers, not personalities of star receivers in different eras. The second receiver was difficult to decide between **Raymond Berry** and Reggie Wayne, but I went with Berry on this one. Like Harrison who was Manning's favorite target, Berry was the favorite target of another All-Time quarterback in Johnny Unitas. He led the NFL in receiving yards and receptions thrice and led the NFL in TD catches twice. Berry was also arguably the best receiver of his time like Harrison and was also an all-time great receiver. **Reggie Wayne** was a great receiver and really became a star when Harrison went down with injuries including leading the NFL in receiving yards in 2007. The fourth receiver was difficult to decide, but I went with **T.Y. Hilton**, who is a great receiver who is often overlooked by other great wide-outs like Julio Jones, Odell Beckham Jr., and DeAndre Hopkins.

**TEs**

|1|John Mackey *(1963-71)*|110.01|3 Championship Games, 1x SB Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Dallas Clark *(2003-11)*|71.65|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|

I went with only tight ends on this All-Time team, but they were great tight ends during their NFL careers. **John Mackey** was a Top 2 tight end during his decade and was one of the best pass-catching tight ends in NFL history. He had 5 seasons where he had at least 600 yards receiving, which wasn't common back in the 1960s. He was also Unitas's second option in the passing game and could break tackles very well. **Dallas Clark** was overshadowed by Harrison and Wayne while he was in Indy, but he was the best tight end in the NFL in 2009 when he caught 10 TDs with 1,106 yards receiving. I wasn't sure whether to include a third tight end or not, but I decided against it because I don't feel that Ken Dilger and/or Marcus Pollard are really too deserving of a roster spot on the All-Time Colts.

|RG2|Alex Sandusky *(1954-66)*|65.15|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RT1|George Kunz *(1975-80)*|75.82|3x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RT2|Ryan Diem *(2001-11)*|55.07|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ|

The offensive line was pretty easy to choose for the All-Time Colts team. **Jim Parker**, a Pro Football Hall of Famer, is one of the greatest offensive guards in NFL history. **Jeff Saturday** was the center for the Colts during Peyton Manning's time there and was one of the best at the time. **Bob Vogel** was a great left tackle who protected Unitas's blind side during his time in Baltimore. **Chris Hinton** was a versatile offensive lineman who could play at any position minus center. I placed at right guard because he had a few very good seasons at that position and the Colts didn't really have any great right guards to choose from. **George Kunz** rounds out the offensive line despite only playing there for five years because he was a solid offensive lineman for Bert Jones and Lydell Mitchell before he got injured and the Colts don't have much to offer at right tackle.

**DEs**

|1|Gino Marchetti *(1953-66)*|196.27|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 11x Pro Bowler, 9x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Dwight Freeney *(2002-12)*|119.23|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 7x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|3|Robert Mathis *(2003-16)*|96.75|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|4|Ordell Braase *(1957-68)*|95.27|4 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 4x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|5|Bubba Smith *(1967-71)*|77.55|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|

Defensive ends are the All-Time Colts' best position when it comes to defense. This All-Time defense doesn't scare me as much as others would, but their defensive ends are great. **Gino Marchetti** is easily the Colts greatest defensive player of all-time and one of the greatest defensive ends to play in the NFL. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Marchetti could do it all and was accolades galore. He was excellent against the run and was even more impressive when it came to rushing the quarterback. **Dwight Freeney** is another scary defensive end. He perfected the spin move and is going to be a future Hall of Famer. One of the best defensive players of his era, Freeney had 125.5 sacks during his 16-year career and was a vicious pass rusher. I was unsure of where to put **Robert Mathis**, but I put him at the defensive end despite him not starting for this team because he played a majority of his career at that position. As an incredible pass rusher, he was a fan favorite in Indy, helped them win a Super Bowl, and once had 19.5 sacks in an NFL season. The late **Ordell Braase** and **Bubba Smith** round out this depth chart and were solid pass rushers that helped the team win some championships back in the 1950s and 1960, the latter who could have been even greater had it not been for a severe injury when he ran into a solid steel pole that was used to mark yardage at the time in a pre-season game.

**DTs**

|1|Art Donovan *(1953-61)*|118.5|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Fred Miller *(1963-72)*|77.34|3 Championship Games, 1x SB Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Gene Lipscomb *(1956-60)*|66|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x Pro Bowl MVP, 3x 1st Team All-Pro|
|4|Billy Ray Smith *(1961-70)*|60.68|3 Championship Games, 1x SB Champ, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Colts don't have a lot of great defensive tackles to choose from for this All-Time team, but they did have some very good ones. Their starting nose tackle is **Art Donovan** and he made one of the most important defensive spots in NFL history during the 1958 NFL Championship Game. His career was more than just that one stop as he excelled against the run.

**MLBs**

|1|Mike Curtis *(1965-75)*|98.13|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Bill Pellington *(1953-64)*|81.5|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 4x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Don Shinnick *(1957-69)*|67.14|4 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

This is where the defense starts getting really weak for this All-Time team. **Mike Curtis**, the greatest linebacker in Colts history, could hit hard and be solid in coverage. **Bill Pellington** was never named to a Pro Bowl team, but he was a great linebacker in his era as well as a great leader. While they both were very good middle linebackers, they don't really impress you too much.

**OLBs**

|1|Ted Hendricks *(1969-73)*|84.3|1x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Duane Bickett *(1985-93)*|65.03|1x Pro Bowler, 1985 Defensive ROTY, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Darius Leonard *(2018-)*|55.7|2018 Defensive ROTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|

Outside linebacker is another weakness on this All-Time Colts squad. **Ted Hendricks**, the first outside linebacker on this team, only played five years for the Colts, but he was a great player. He made three Pro Bowls in Baltimore and played a key role in helping them win the Super Bowl in the 1970 season. **Duane Bickett**, the other starting outside linebacker, was a very good linebacker who leads the Colts all-time in tackles. However, he was overshadowed because he played on some pretty bad Colts teams. The toughest decision for this team was deciding on who the third outside linebacker was going to be. In the end, I went with **Darius Leonard**, who just finished his rookie season with the Colts about three months ago. He was a maniac all over the field, leading the NFL in tackles just this past season and helping Indy improve from the 30th ranked defense and one of the worst teams in the NFL to the 10th ranked defense and a playoff berth. Although he has only played one season for the team, I feel like he's already made an impact as an all-time Colts linebacker and will hopefully make some Pro Bowls in the next few years.

**CBs**

|1|Bobby Boyd *(1960-68)*|114.64|2 Championship Games, 2x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Bert Rechichar *(1953-59)*|61|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Lenny Lyles *(1958, 1961-69)*|52.81|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 1x Pro Bowler|
|4|Milt Davis *(1957-60)*|47|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|

Like pretty much all of the other positions on defense, the All-Time Colts cornerbacks were difficult to decide, especially the final three guys who made it at that position. **Bobby Boyd** is the undisputed first cornerback on this team. In nine seasons, Boyd was a ball-hawking cornerback and has the 13th most interceptions in league history with 57. He is usually a forgotten figure, not only in Colts history but also among the all-time great defensive backs that have played in the NFL. **Bert Rechichar** is the other starting cornerback, but not by much. He helped Baltimore win two championships and made the Pro Bowl thrice, averaging 5 picks a season, in each of those three seasons. **Lenny Lyles** and **Milt Davis** got the last two cornerback spots over Vontae Davis and Eugene Daniel. They both were solid cornerbacks during the 1950s and 1960s. Milt Davis was an underrated defensive back who only played 4 seasons, but could have been an all-time great had it not been for the racism of his era that caused him to retire early. In those four seasons, the Colts won the NFL championship twice and Davis also led the NFL in interceptions twice in that span.

**Ss**

|1|Rick Volk *(1967-75)*|86.04|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Bob Sanders *(2004-10)*|82|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x Defensive POTY, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|
|3|Jerry Logan *(1963-72)*|79.5|3 Championship Games, 1x SB Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|4|Andy Nelson *(1957-63)*|59.39|2 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|

I had a very difficult time deciding the order of the safeties for this All-Time Colts squad. There were three guys who I felt each had the case for the first safety on this roster. In the end, I went with **Rick Volk** as the first safety, **Bob Sanders** as the other starting safety, and **Jerry Logan** at the third safety in the depth chart. Volk was a very good safety for the Colts and made a crucial interception late in Super Bowl V that set up a game-tying touchdown. The Colts would eventually win that game and without Volk's interception, the Baltimore Colts would have never won the Super Bowl. Sanders was a dominant player during his tenure with the Colts. He could do it all from hitting hard to pressuring the quarterback and could match up to anybody's ability. Although he was a brilliant player, he only played two complete seasons, but if Sanders doesn't come back from injury in the middle of the 2006 season, the Colts would not have won the Super Bowl that year. Logan was a Colt for his entire career and started opposite of Rick Volk back in the '60s and '70s. He was named to 3 Pro Bowls during his time in Baltimore and was pretty solid.

**ST**

|1|Adam Vinatieri *(2006-)*|60.23|2x AFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Rohn Stark *(1982-94)*|97.33|4x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Clarence Verdin *(1988-93)*|42.03|2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|

The Colts have a solid special teams unit. **Adam Vinatieri** is one the greatest kickers in NFL history and was a very accurate one in the clutch as seen with his time in New England and Indy. **Rohn Stark** was a great punter during his 13-year stint with the Colts and had a whopping 43,162 punting yards in Baltimore and Indianapolis. **Clarence Verdin**, also known as CNN, was a talker and backed up that talking by having the most kick and punt returns for TDs in Colts history.

**Summary:**

As I was rushing to get this done for today, I will not be going over the overall team summary, but I will be pointing out some statistics. 46 out of the 53 players on this roster have made at least one Pro Bowl in either Baltimore or Indianapolis with 45 of the players making at least one All-Pro team with the Colts. Out of the 50 players who have made an All-Pro team with the team, 37 of them have been named 1st Team All-Pro as a Colt. There are four NFL MVPs on this team with each of the quarterbacks on this team (Manning, Unitas, Jones) and Lenny Moore. Manning and Jones have won Offensive Player of the Year as a Colt, while Bob Sanders is the only Colt to win Defensive Player of the Year, back in 2007.

Anyways, that is the end of this All-Time Colts post. I just want to give a shout-out to each of the writers for this series so far. You guys have done great, and for the writers who have not posted, I'm ecstatic to see your work. Thank you and have a great day! :)

This teams Tackles… Stacked, this teams edge rushers… Stacked, this team’s defensive backs… Stacked.  The QB’s… Whack.  Really this team is good all across the board.  Even the QB’s while not great a really solid players.  This may not be the best team I’ve put together but it’s definitely one of the deepest teams on these lists.  Every position has a good backup. 


While I’m not super sold on most of these players as HOFers I can definitely think Dumervil, Gostkowski, and Brandon Marshall all have a pretty good argument to at least be considered.  I do think the Haloti Ngata and Nick Mangold are the surefire guys from this class.  Unfortunately, both of them start at positions HOF voters tend to overlook.",nfl

120,"Let's rank the NFL's home uniforms with the MaxDiff Market Research technique
EDIT:  I've had to remove the link to the survey from this post because so many of you have participated that it wrecked my server. If you still want to take the survey you can find the link on my Twitter [@FanJuicer](https://twitter.com/fanjuicer). Results will be posted in a few weeks. 

Last year, I did a poll on this sub using this same technique (MaxDiff – more info below) where we ranked the NFL’s logos, which you can view [HERE](https://fanjuicer.com/2018/05/every-nfl-logo-ranked-by-over-1400-fans). You guys seemed to enjoy that post, so I thought I’d do a similar one ranking the NFL’s home uniforms. I think these results will be interesting. Also, I included the Jets’ new and old uniforms in this exercise because I’m interested in if you guys like the new or old Jets’ unis more. 


**If you are new to MaxDiff Polling** or would like more information about this system and how it differs from traditional polling, I've provided some information below.

I'm a market researcher, and we often need people to rank long lists of items (such as brands, product ideas, logos, ad designs, etc.). For a variety of reasons, we usually don't use traditional ranking methods where each participant assigns a rank number to each item because studies show that most people can't handle that task. Their top and bottom ranked items may reflect their true preferences, but it is a toss up if their middle ranked items actually reflect how they truly feel.

Instead we use a different technique called **MaxDiff**. MaxDiff is different from traditional rankings in the following ways:


* Instead of having everyone provide a straight ranking (i.e. Team X is ""1"", Team Y is ""2""), participants instead are presented sets containing two teams. 

* In each set they indicate the item they like more. 

* I use fancy math (Hierarchical Bayes estimation procedure) at the end of the study to calculate a full ranking for each respondent. 


This ranking system has an advantage over traditional rankings in the following ways.


* Shows distance between ranks. The distance between items ranked 1 and 2 need not be the same as the distance between items ranked 3 and 4. This lets us see natural breaks in how teams are perceived, which allows us to group teams into **TIERS**

* More accurately reflects middle ranked teams. Research on research (yes, that is a real thing) shows that people aren't really able to rank a long list of items. They can tell you their top two or three items and their last few items, but it is a toss up if their middle ranked items really reflect their true preferences. This method gets around that by breaking the task down into sets of four, so that everyone's middle ranked items actually reflect their true opinions.

* Gives the analyst conducting the poll the ability to identify and throw out bad respondents that don't know enough about the teams to give meaningful opinions. 

If you have any more questions about this system, feel free to ask. Thanks for your participation and for letting me contribute to this awesome community. If I get enough participation, results will be posted in a few weeks.",nfl

134,"2018 Receiver EPA Analysis
 Hello everyone,

Appreciate the feedback both on here and on twitter. Evan Silva actually followed me yesterday and sauced me a retweet which I thought was awesome. So its nice to know that the people find the stuff interesting.

Today I'm going to show a couple graphs on Receiver EPA's for 2018, I'm saying Receiver and not WR since I included anyone with at least 100 targets, so TEs and RBs included.

For those who might be confused about EPA; the best way I can explain it is that it's very similar to WAR for baseball. A very powerful statistic that takes into account situations on the field and ultimately measures if someone is #GoodAtFootball. So, it is likely that when someone is #GoodAtFoodball and is given opportunity, they will produce in the fantasy world.

I'm a big O-Line guy, the back bone of a football team. In previous posts I mentioned that O-Line had a direct relationship with Running Back EPA, and QB EPA. Now lets see receiver epa.

I'm gonna provide some background on this graph to avoid confusion. On the x-axis is O-Line rating which I determined as Adjusted Sack % via pro football outsiders (note: notice how the x-axis is decreasing). So the lower the sack %, the better. The Y-Axis is the EPA/Target metric we care about. If the two variables had a link you would see the blue line going upwards at a 45 degree angle. As you can see the line of best fit is a little flat, showing only some relation.

I'll explain a few points so people get a gist of what to look at.

\- Deandre Hopkins, able to produce somehow given his situation

\- Tyler Boyd, had fantastic EPA/target despite with a middle of the pack o-line

\- TY Hilton, was awesome and was also in a great situation.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/2u9hq61aigr21.png

But like I said, O-Line and Receiver EPA didn't have an amazing correlation. Now one of the age old fantasy chicken or the egg question is if the WR made the QB good, or the other way around. Now lets look at ESPNs Total QBR against EPA/Target for receivers. My x-axis is now QBR so in theory, if QBR goes up then EPA/Target will also.

Boom, direct correlation. Some might think this is silly and say well duh. But think about it, we always see freak athletes like Corey Davis who should be a very good WR, but he has been pretty average fantasy-wise. Was it his performance, or his situation. I'd lean his situation. Generally speaking, Receivers perform better when their QB is also very good.

Again I know it seems silly but think about this chart the next time you are thinking of drafting a freak athlete WR who might not have the best QB. They could be a Tyler Boyd and still produce regardless, or an Odell who couldn't do much with a poor 2018 Eli.

Here's the list of guys currently eligible or senior candidates that I'd personally say have a very solid case for induction. This is not a scientific list, it's based mostly on my opinions and analysis of what kinds of accolades and statistics typically get guys in, though it is a very well informed opinion. I'm not saying I'd put them all in but the arguments are solidly there based on their position's historical standards and what those standards should be (and excluding any off-field explanations for them not being in.) In bold are the guys that I think it's absurd they're not in and/or will almost certainly be in within the next few years. Also this is a list that only includes a handful of guys who played before the 1960s, so it could use some help there.

Different people might add or subtract a few from this list but the point of this is that I don't really think it's supported that the Hall keeps people from certain franchises out. The teams most fucked over seem to be the teams with the most guys in. LA, Dallas, and Green Bay are the only 3 with 7+, and the Steelers (the team often cited as having ""too many undeserving guys in"") have the highest number of egregious snubs imo.

Feel free to call me an asshole for leaving someone off, or tell me why it's ridiculous I've included someone. I'm far from perfect and other opinions always help.

160,"Why 1984 and 2013 are the best NFL seasons ever
The NBA’s 2015-2016 season has been called the greatest season in NBA history. Apart from the many events that transpired throughout the season itself, the climax came when LeBron’s Cavs beat the record-setting Warriors after coming back from a 3-1 lead in the finals. This got me thinking, what could the NFL’s version of this season be? After a bit of thought, I am convinced that 1984 and 2013 are the 2 best NFL seasons of all time and here’s why



1984

Before the season began, the Colts has relocated to Indiana and the Jets moved to New Jersey. Much like the record-setting Warriors, the 49ers became the first NFL team to win 15 games in a season. The 49ers only loss was by 3 points. Meanwhile, Dan Marino has the best season a QB has ever had up to that point. Marino, in his first year as a starter broke the NFL record for yards with 5084, becoming the first to throw for over 5000 yards. Marino also threw a record 48 touchdowns, surpassing the old record by 12. At the time, his season also was 5th all-time in Passer Rating. Walter Payton set the NFL record for rushing yards in a career. Eric Dickerson set the record for most yards in a season. Mark Clayton set the record for receiving touchdowns. Mark Gastineau set the record for most sacks. The 49ers and Dolphins would eventually meet in that years Super Bowl in the 49er’s own state of California.

According to SRS (a way to rank teams based on record and opponents), specifically SRS that includes the playoffs, this was the highest SRS sum in Super Bowl history, with a combined SRS of 25.3, so as expected with one of the best teams ever going against one of the best offenses ever, stats tell us this was one of the best matchups ever. Sadly, Super Bowl XIX would end in a blowout. Joe Montana set the Super Bowl rushing record for a QB and also for Passer Rating that game as a side-note. The 49ers set the Super Bowl record for yards and tied it for points.

Source: http://www.footballperspective.com/ranking-super-bowls-by-playoff-adjusted-srs/



2013

In 2013, the NFL saw a record 11.985 points scored with an average of 46.8 points per game. Both the league-wide touchdown and field goal records were broken and kickers made a record 86.5% of their field goals. Peyton Manning threw a record 5,477 yards and 55 touchdowns, breaking the yardage record by 1, and the touchdown record by 5. The Broncos surpassed the 2007 Patriots as the #1 scoring offense of all time with 606 points. Nick Foles had the 3rd highest season ever for passer rating that year, putting him above Manning that season, who had the 5th highest ever. However, the 2013 season wasn’t all about offense. The Seattle Seahawks and their Legion of Boom had one of the best defenses of all time. The Seahawks tied a franchise record 13-5 season. The Seahawks led the league in points allowed, yards allowed, and takeaways, becoming the first to do so since the 1985 Bears.

Super Bowl XLVIII marked the 3rd time the #1 seed from each conference met and at the time, the 7th time the #1 defense met the #1 offense. SRS shows how legendary these two teams were with a combined SRS of 24.5, the second-highest of all time right after the 49ers-Dolphins match of 1984. Sadly, this Super Bowl would also end in a blowout. 




Anyways, those are my thoughts on why the 2013 and 1984 seasons are arguably the best in NFL history.
Interestingly, both Super Bowls I mentioned had a SRS difference of 1.3 exactly, meaning not only were both matchups 2 great teams going up against each other, but they also weren’t that far apart from each other, yet both ended in blowouts. Interestingly, the #1 defense beat the #1 offense both times. Let me know what u guys thought and if there’s any other season you think is the best in NFL history",nfl

This team’s offense looks pretty good.  Aaron Rodgers absolutely makes them one of the better offenses on these draft teams but without him they’re fairly average.  


The defense’s front seven is stacked with Pass Rushers and, although not great, the defensive backs should be able to cover long enough for a lot of sacks to occur. 


This team does have one of the best special team squads I’ve seen so far.  Colquitt and Denney have been with the same team for their entire careers which is super rare for a special teamer.  Gould spent 10 years on the Bears and has been really good for all the teams he has played with.  Sproles and Cribbs are all time greats return men. 


Speaking of Sproles because of how electric he is at special teams as well as running back I can see him getting into the HOF.  I also think Aaron Rodgers and Demarcus Ware are shoo-ins.  Because of his role on 3 Super Bowl teams Logan Mankins should go in as well but he may have to wait a year or two.  Cameron Wake is the only other player on this team I see getting into the HOF eventually.  He should break 100+ sacks this year and he was also an amazing player in Canada.",nfl

Before I begin, I just want to shout out /u/robdog1330 for allowing me to do this post and for setting up this series. Also, the next magic number post (which was supposed to come today) is coming on Thursday at 8:00 AM ET, since a lot of my time was taken up by this post. Having said all of that, let’s dive into the all-time roster for one of the youngest franchises in the NFL, the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Two things to keep in mind with this post:

- **The Jaguars do not have any Hall of Fame players.** And with the exception of Tony Boselli (who 100% deserves to be in, seeing as he was arguably the most dominant tackle of his era), right now, they’ve got nobody that’s going to sniff HOF consideration.

- **The Jaguars only began play in 1995.** This means that they are an incredibly young team. There’s not a whole lot of players to choose from when compared to other teams like the Packers and the Cowboys. A lot of guys who only played a few years with the team are going to be on this list, especially since the Jags have not had much historic success

So, with all of that said, let’s look at the all-time 53-man roster for the Jaguars.

**Head Coach: Tom Coughlin (1995-2002)**

There’s nobody else that could take this spot (except for maybe Gus Bradley^/s). Coughlin’s led the Jaguars to the postseason four times when every other coach has done it three times combined. Coughlin’s led the Jaguars to two division titles (AFC Central) when every other coach has only done it once combined. Coughlin’s led the Jaguars to the AFC Championship twice (1996, 1999) when every other coach has only done it once combined (2017). Coughlin’s the only coach in Jags history with an above-.500 record (.531), led the team to what was then-unprecedented success for an expansion team to the point where the NFL literally had to rewrite the rules for the Browns and Texans to make it harder to compete right off the bat, and his front office return in 2017 immediately resulting in an AFC Championship appearance doesn’t hurt his resume either.

**Quarterbacks**

Depth Chart | Name | Years with Team
--- | --- | ---
1 | Mark Brunell | 1995-2003
2 | David Garrard | 2002-2010
3 | Blake Bortles | 2014-2018

There’s no debate as to who the #1 QB on this list is, and that’s Mark Brunell. He’s the all-time franchise leader in passing yards (25,698) and touchdowns (144), has the most wins in team history by a comfortable margin (63), and is the only Jags QB to make it to multiple Pro Bowls. On top of that, in his second season with the team in 1996, he led the team to the AFC Championship while leading the league in passing yards. Due to the injuries to Byron Leftwich, David Garrard was the de facto starting QB of the Jaguars for more than half a decade, and had a great 2007 season where he led the Jaguars to the playoffs and didn’t throw an interception until December. Blake Bortles rounds out the QBs on this list, as he’s got the second most passing yards and touchdowns in franchise history. He also holds the single-season record for most touchdowns (35) and yards (4,428) in franchise history.

Right now, there can’t be any debate for the three halfbacks on the list. Who gets the top spot is more than open for interpretation, but Taylor, MJD, and Stewart have to be the guys on this list. Fred Taylor is in the Pride of the Jaguars and leads the team in career rushing yards (11,271). He had seven seasons with over 1,100 rushing yards, and it’s a shame that he only made it to one Pro Bowl in 2007, when he was chosen as an alternate. My favorite Jaguar of all-time (the best player, without a doubt, from the second generation of Jags fans) comes in second on the depth chart, as the all-time leader in rushing touchdowns (68). The fact that he led the league in rushing in 2011 when defenses were stacking the box since the passing game was led by Blaine Gabbert at quarterback and Chastin West, Mike Thomas, and Jarrett Dillard at wide receiver will never cease to amaze me. From 2009-11, MJD had 4,321 rushing yards and 5,386 yards from scrimmage. After injuries cut his 2012 season short, he was never the same, but in his prime, he was arguably the most fun player to watch at the turn of the decade. Plus, he [ended Shawne Merriman’s career in one play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgGmAnIzU9E) on one of the greatest halfback blocks of all-time. James Stewart takes the final spot for the halfbacks; though he never quite lived up to first round expectations when he was chosen in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft, he still had a solid career with the Jaguars, rushing for 33 touchdowns and having 13 rushing touchdowns in Jacksonville’s 14-2 season in 1999.

Greg Jones gets the fullback spot, and no other Jaguar comes even remotely close in this position. He played in 115 games for the team, and at one point, was so good as a lead blocker that he warranted a contract making him [the highest paid fullback at the time in NFL history](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/9929-jaguars-reward-greg-jones-with-rich-contract).

**Wide Receivers**

Depth Chart | Name | Years with Team
--- | --- | ---
1 | Jimmy Smith | 1995-2005
2 | Keenan McCardell | 1996-2001
3 | Allen Robinson | 2014-2017
4 | Allen Hurns | 2014-2017
5 | Cecil Shorts III | 2011-2014

There’s no debating that Thunder &amp; Lightning get the top two spots on this list (side note: if you haven’t watched the *A Football Life* documentary on them yet, I highly recommend it; it’s really good). Jimmy Smith is a borderline-HOF wide receiver, finishing his career in Jacksonville with 12,287 yards and 67 touchdowns. He had nine seasons with over 1,000 receiving yards, and from 1995-2005, he had the second most receiving yards of anyone in football; only Marvin Harrison (12,331) had more, and he’s in the Hall of Fame. Keenan McCardell, in that same stretch, had the sixth most, and had four seasons of over 1,100 yards with the Jaguars, making the Pro Bowl in 1996.

After the top two guys, the list definitely gets thinner. From 2005 (Jimmy Smith’s final season) to 2015, the Jaguars never had a 1,000-yard receiver. You could make the argument that Allen Robinson’s 2015 season was the most dominant season by a receiver in franchise history; he led the league with 14 touchdowns and had 1,400 receiving yards. Allen Hurns went from an UDFA out of Miami (FL) to one of the best receivers in franchise history, having a stretch in 2015 with a receiving touchdown in seven consecutive games. Like Robinson, Hurns also finished with over 1,000 receiving yards in 2015. Cecil Shorts III should’ve had a 1,000-yard season in 2012 before a concussion ended his season at 979 yards; he had two really solid seasons with the Jaguars in 2012 and 2013, and could be counted on for some [ridiculously clutch plays in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBLrj5jHij4).

**Tight Ends**

Depth Chart | Name | Years with Team
--- | --- | ---
1 | Marcedes Lewis | 2006-2017
2 | Kyle Brady | 1999-2006
3 | Pete Mitchell | 1995-2002

The first two rounds of the 2006 NFL Draft for the Jaguars were amazing. They got one of the best halfbacks of the era in the second round in Maurice Jones-Drew, and got an amazing blocking tight end for a decade in the first round in Marcedes Lewis. He’s best known for his 2010 season, where he caught 10 touchdowns, and for his amazing London game in 2017 against the Ravens, where [he caught 3 touchdowns in one game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjPFlVRtA2M). The Jets whiffed badly taking Brady over Warren Sapp in the first round of the 1995 NFL Draft, but he was a serviceable TE for Jacksonville at the turn of the decade. He finished his Jags career with 2,500 receiving yards, including a 64-reception season in 2000. Pete Mitchell takes the final spot on this list, having 191 receptions and over 2,000 receiving yards in four seasons with the team from 1995-1998.",nfl

188,"Replay Hasn't Changed in 20 Years, and It's Destroying the Viewing Experience of the Game
In 1999, the NFL introduced the Coach’s Challenge. It was a completely new ripple, with rules and strategies that still felt like it belonged in the spirit of the game. The NFL leveraged new, cutting edge technology in an innovative and creative way, completely changing the public mindset of officiating for the better. 

20 years later, the NFL and sports as a whole have completely butchered the idea of replay and the games they are reviewing. Not a single professional or amateur league (outside of tennis) has innovated on replay in any meaningful way except by using newer cameras. For all intents and purposes, replay in football is exactly the same as it was before Tom Brady came into the league, with the only changes being that it is used more and more to litigate play outcomes over the real-time call. 

At this point, replay is not making games better, but worse. What was originally meant to fact check for on field officials has turned into a frame by frame perspective in 1/32 of real time, and being applied to a ruleset not designed for it. Replay has transformed from a runback of what happened into a rewrite of reality. 

This was never more apparent than in last night’s NCAA championship game, when Texas Tech had a turnover from knocking the ball out of bounds. At least, that was the overturned ruling of the original call on the floor, in which Virginia knocked the ball out of bounds. There is not a single level of basketball anywhere in the world where this play would be called out of bounds on Texas Tech. Anyone with eyes knows that Virginia knocked the ball out of bounds. [But because we can look at what happened in 1/128 of real time](https://streamable.com/de2zq), we can see that the right pinky of the Texas Tech player may have possibly actually been the last human surface contacting the basketball, therefore it is UVA ball. 

This complete slavery to slow motion video is slowly decaying the way we watch games and think about moment to moment plays. No longer is this clearly a defensive knock out by Virginia, but a 5 minute stoppage to see if there is an angle and speed that shows otherwise. The fan no longer is waiting for the next play at a whistle, but holding their breath waiting for the ultra HD slowed down NBCee-It angle. 

In basketball, this has been going against the spirit of the game for years, and actively harming the sport. Officials will spend 5 minutes reviewing the exact tenth of a second a ball went out of bounds, while granting each team an extended timeout to draw up a play and talk strategy. Which is more impactful, the full rest period and timeout, or the .01 of a second? 

We’ve already seen this pop up in the NFL national conscious several times, most famously with the catch fiasco that went on the entirety of the 2017-2018 season. Fans, players, coaches, and ex-officials all could no longer figure out what a catch was. Even after watching 100 replays from different angles and speeds, there was still huge disagreement over whether Jesse James caught the ball, or Sefarian-Jenkins fumbled through the endzone. Even though when watching the game at full speed, what the call should be is incredibly evident to everyone. The NFL smartly moved back towards the accepted idea of “if it’s a catch it’s a catch”, and were universally praised for it this season.

And now, pass interference is allowed to be reviewed, and I believe the NFL will be worse than any other sport in terms of the degradation of the viewing experience. Every single throw, ESPECIALLY under two minutes, will be met with held breath and anticipation, wondering if PI will be challenged. Teams will hurry to the line following routine pass plays or wait around before deciding whether to challenge. Officials will stare at odd angles at 1/1000 of a second speed judging whether a hand made contact with a shoulder when the ball was catchable. All the while, everyone watching will now in real-time with 95% accuracy whether PI occurred or not. 

This is my fear for the league and concern going forward, that no one has tried to innovate on replay for two decades shows a lack of creativity and innovation that truly changed the sport for the better. Technology and its uses have exploded in the years since replay was approved in many ways other than cameras, and yet no movement has been made to enhance the reliability of the game in that capacity. Could targeting determine the spot of the ball accurately and quickly? Could lasers determine whether a ball crossed the plane? Could pressure sensors determine where and when a knee or limb was down?

I hope that the spirit of replay eventually shifts into smarter, efficient, and innovative ways. Accurate calls obviously are integral to the game, and for many years, replay was the best way of correcting mistakes. But for whatever reason, it seems it was decided to be the only way. I hope someone gets to the competition committee and makes a compelling case for the outdateded-ness of replay, and looks to improve on the system in a real and game changing way like its original bold implementation 20 years ago. But judging by how the sport and its decision makers approach it, I’m sure this time 10 years from now we’ll be reviewing in 7000fps whether someone’s off pinky grazed the facemask of Tom Brady while sacking him.",nfl

193,"Calculating How Teams Value Positions Based on First Round Drafts
This data sheet was created using the last 51 drafts to see how teams value positions based on how early in the first round that certain positions are chosen. I had to combine FB with RB and had to combine S, CB, and DB since these were not separated in earlier drafts. I analyzed the results three ways: how many of each position make up each pick, what percentage of each position was taken with each pick, and, out of every draft, what is the percentage of a specific player/pick combination. I used this analysis to then find the ""average"" pick for each player based on how often they go in each spot. I also calculated a type of value for each position by dividing the number of first round picks of each position by the number of players of that position are usually on the field (using 2018 offensive personal stats to calculate this average). I then multiplied the ""average"" pick and their positional ""value"" to get an adjusted value, then compared this to average salaries of each position. This had a correlation of over 50%. I would love to have the average length of each positions NFL career to factor that in too, but could not find a reliable source. The whole point of this was to make a mock draft, which is not great, but is not complete dumpster fire either. Let me know what you think and if you have any suggestions. 

TL;DR
I used draft history to see if the positions we value the most are consistent with draft history, I also made a bad mock draft and some fun graphs.

220,"Countdown to the draft: The best players to be drafted 16th overall in the NFL Draft
Hello everyone,

As of today, there are 16 days left until the first round of the NFL Draft begins, and this is a continuation of my countdown to the draft, where I will be outlining the best players taken at each draft slot from 32 to 1. Today is the 16th overall pick, which is currently held by the Panthers this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 16th overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Jerry Rice|WR|1985|SF|250|HOF
Bobby Bell|DE/LB|1963|MIN|133|HOF, Signed w/ Chiefs in AFL instead
Troy Polamalu|S|2003|PIT|115|Future HOF
Raymond Clayborn|CB|1977|NE|102|
Luis Sharpe|T|1982|STL|98|
Chester McGlockton|DT|1992|LAR|97|
Santana Moss|WR|2001|NYJ|93|
Julian Peterson|LB|2000|SF|90|
Jim Ritcher|G|1980|BUF|89|
Blair Bush|C|1978|CIN|88|

If you think of someone who you think should be added, let me know!

Tomorrow, we’ll get to the 15th overall pick.

Honorable mention: MBC, Thielen, Adams, K.Allen, JuJu.

Just a side note, I think MBC noticeably declined last year. Not a huge amount, but a relevant amount. Stats looked good, but also Ben force fed him a lot while also being inefficient while targeting him. Also, Carr is much unproven compared to Ben.",nfl

The reason I specified modern is that many decades ago players were almost required to play multiple positions. Nowadays you virtually never see that come up.

My picks:

* Cam Newton (passer and runner)

* Michael Vick (only non-RB with 1000 rushing yards in a season)

* LaDainian Tomlinson (dominant in the run and great with receiving but everyone overlooks his passing statistics)

* Tavon Austin (decent receiver but above average runner)

* Patrick Ricard (only active player I can think of that regularly plays both sides of the ball as he lines up as defensive tackle and running back)

* Russell Wilson (size of a halfback with arms like [trebuchets](reddit.com/r/trebuchetmemes))

* Marshall Faulk (both he and his brother Kevin are amazing runner-receivers)

* Troy Brown (wide receiver that also played some DB for good portions of games)

* Roger Craig (runner-receiver that became the first player with 1000 rushing and 1000 receiving yards in a season)

* Darren Sproles (running back that makes a great receiver and excellent return man)

* Chris Thompson (decent RB that posted one of the best receiving DVOAs in history during his 2017 season)

* Alvin Kamara (amazing in both pounding the rock and catching dimes)

* Christian McCaffrey (the Panthers version of Kamara)

* LeVeon Bell (became a serious *bell*cow in Pittsburgh for both run and pass plays)

This is a pretty solid team.  Aside from Linebackers there is no real weakness on this team and even.  This team May not have a lot of great players like other drafts but has a lot of really good players at every position.  


This was a great draft for San Diego they as they managed to pick up 6 players that started for them long term.  


I am starting Rivers at QB I feel like on a technical level he is a lot better the Roethlisberger and Manning.  He has had less talent to work with then Roethlisberger and they’re stats are still almost identical.  Roethlisberger does get the second string spot in the regular season but as soon as playoffs roll around I’m starting Manning.


I see all 3 QB’s getting into the HOF at some point.  However, since none of them have ever made an All-Pro it could cause them to wait.  Roethlisberger and Rivers did play in a conference with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady so they do have that as an excuse for their lack of APs. Eli Manning gets in because of the Super Bowl MVPs but he probably waits a few years.  


Larry Fitzgerald and Jason Peters should both get into the HOF in their first years of eligibility.  Jarred Allen and Vince Wilfork may not be first ballot guys but they’ll both get in.  I also think Wes Welker gets in but probably in a much later class.  He just did too much as an undrafted guy to be excluded.",nfl
304,"With the schedule about a week away from being released, what are some of your predictions for the primetime games?
In week 1 I think that the SNF game will be between the Patriots and the Browns. I would have to think that NBC would not want to pass up on the evil empire versus the up and coming team for an intriguing week 1 matchup. Browns may also get some primetime games with PIT, BAL, LA and maybe even the Jets

The Rams-Saints rematch probably will be a SNF game scheduled around week 7 or 8. It will not be a MNF game because ESPN just doesn't care about high profile matchups like this, plus it will be an exciting game with two explosive offenses and the Saints looking to exact revenge for their heartbreaking loss in the NFC Championship game",nfl

307,"Countdown to the draft: The best players to be drafted 17th overall in the NFL Draft
Hello everyone,

As of today, there are 17 days left until the first round of the NFL Draft begins, and this is a continuation of my countdown to the draft, where I will be outlining the best players taken at each draft slot from 32 to 1. Today is the 17th overall pick, which is currently held by the Giants this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 17th overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Emmitt Smith|RB|1990|DAL|170|HOF
Gene Upshaw|G|1967|OAK|151|HOF
Mel Renfro|S/CB|1964|DAL|130|HOF
Steve Hutchinson|G|2001|SEA|119|Future HOF
Louis Wright|CB|1975|DEN|109|
Chad Greenway|LB|2006|MIN|80|
Damien Woody|C/G|1999|NE|74|
Mike Iupati|G|2010|SF|69|Nice
Fred McNeill|LB|1974|MIN|69|Nice
Nate Solder|T|2011|NE|69|Nice

Tomorrow, we’ll get to the 16th overall pick.

316,"32 NFL All-Time Teams in 32 Days (Day 16) All-Time New York Giants
Hello and good morning! I, Robdog1330, am back with the All-Time team for my New York Football Giants.

**History of the New York Football Giants:**

In 1925, Tim Mara invested $500 to become the founder of the NFL's New York Giants. It only took three seasons until the Giants won their first championship, which they achieved in 1927. From 1933 to 1946, the Giants would make it to the championship game eight times, winning twice in 1934 and in 1938. After nine years of coming up short, the Giants made it to six championship games from 1956 to 1963. However, they only won one of those championships, winning in 1956. After 1963, the Giants would miss the playoffs each year from 1964 to 1980. Then, a generational linebacker entered the 1981 NFL Draft, who 26 out of the 28 NFL General Managers said they would pick 1st overall if they had the choice. The Saints had the 1st pick that year and their GM, Bum Phillips, was one of the two GMs who stated they wouldn't pick him first overall. That linebacker would be Lawrence Taylor. Lawrence Taylor put the Giants back into relevance, making the playoffs his rookie year, and winning two Super Bowls in 1986 and in 1990. With the exception of the 2000 season when they made the Super Bowl but got humiliated the 2000 Ravens defense, Big Blue remained mediocre for the next fifteen years. However, the Giants drafted Eli Manning in 2004, who would lead the team to two Super Bowls in 2007 and 2011. In 2019, with Eli Manning approaching the twilight of his career, Odell Beckham Jr. traded, and Saquon Barkley carrying the load, the Giants will be rebuilding and (hopefully) building a solid team around Barkley for the next few years.

**Methodology:**

For the depth charts at each position using a formula that I will call ""[The All-Time Teams Formula](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqtpOiw6hu47-LlZeXlXp_-zDu99ZafGQDwKly8OWFc/edit?usp=sharing)"" The formula only accounts for a player's time with that team. For example, Night Train Lane's score for the Cardinals does not include his accolades for the Detroit Lions. Secondly, stats didn't play too much of a factor in the way I ranked these players. I prefer Pro Football Reference's AV as a basis rather than stats because of era adjustments like QBs passing the ball a lot more in today's game. I would also like to note that I did not watch every player whether it be in-game or in highlights. This is especially true for those who played pre-1990. I did, however, do a lot of research on many of these guys.

Anyways, here is the All-Time Giants team underway!

**Coaches (Parenthesis represents years spent with the Giants as a coach of some sort)**

Head Coach: Steve Owen *(1930-53)*

Offensive Coordinator: Vince Lombardi *(1954-58)*

Quarterbacks and Receivers Coach: Tom Coughlin (*1988-90, 2004-15*)

Co-Defensive Coordinators: Bill Parcells *(1981-90)* and Bill Belichick *(1979-90)*

Defensive Backs Coach: Tom Landry *(1954-59)*

**QBs**

|1|Eli Manning *(2004-)*|122.67|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 2x SB MVP, 4x Pro Bowler|Eli may be a shell of his former self right now, but he is an All-Time Giants great and is their all-time leading passer. A 2-time SB champion, Eli has always come through in the clutch, especially in big moments. Not to mention, he is also one of the NFL's greatest iron men of all-time.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Phil Simms *(1979-93)*|120.01|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 1x SB MVP, 1x NFL MVP, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|The Giants star QB in the 1980s, and early 1990s, Simms was a pretty effective passer with an MVP and 2 SB Rings. He had arguably the greatest SB performance by a QB of all-time by completing 22 out of 25 of his attempts and led them in SB XXI over the Denver Broncos.|
|3|Y.A. Tittle *(1961-64)*|104.91|3 Championship Games, 1x MVP, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x Stat Leader|Although Tittle was only on the Giants for 4 years, he was also considered for the starting QB job. He set the NFL single-season passing TD record with 33 in 1962 and broke that the next year with 36. Tittle never got it done in the Championship game, but he was a TD machine for his time.|

**RBs**

|1|Frank Gifford *(1952-64)*|151.79|5 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 1x MVP, 8x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|One of the most versatile players in NFL history, Gifford played in the Pro Bowl at the cornerback, running back, and receiver position. He also won an MVP in 1956 when he led his team to become NFL Champions, and could throw the ball well for a non-QB with 14 TD passes.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Tuffy Leemans *(1936-43)*|95.5|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 5x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|Another versatile player at running back, Leemans led the league in rushing in 1936. He also threw 25 TD passes and helped the Giants win the 1938 NFL Championship.|
|3|Tiki Barber *(1997-2006)*|95.26|1x NFC Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|While Barber really came into his own towards the end of his career, Tiki is the all-time leading rusher for the franchise. He led the NFL in all-purpose yards in both 2004 and 2005 and was an excellent receiver out of the backfield.|
|4|Ron Johnson *(1970-75)*|74.12|2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|One of the best backs in the NFL during the early 70s, Johnson became the first Giants player to run for 1,000 yards in a season. He was also an All-Pro who was overshadowed by the likes of Larry Brown, and O.J. Simpson.|
|FB1|Ken Strong *(1933-35, 1939, 1944-47)*|87|6 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Strong was a good rusher, receiver, kicker, and punter during his time in the Big Apple. He scored the go-ahead touchdown late in the famous ""Sneakers Game"" to give the Giants the lead in the 1934 NFL Championship for good against the undefeated Bears.|
|FB2|Alex Webster *(1955-64)*|76.89|6 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|A reliable blocker, runner, and receiver, Webster scored two TDs with 103 all-purpose years in the second ""Sneakers Game"" in the 1956 NFL Championship against the Bears.|

**WRs**

|1|Kyle Rote *(1951-61)*|87.69|4 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|A receiver converted from running back, Rote was a team captain, and held all of the Giants receiving records until they were broken by Amani Toomer.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Del Shofner *(1961-67)*|82.97|3 Championship Games, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro|Another forgotten name, Shofner was the first Giants receiver to catch for 1,000 yards. Despite only having three great seasons with the team, Shofner was Tittle's primary target during their time together.|
|3|Odell Beckham Jr. *(2014-18)*|75.2|3x Pro Bowler, 2014 Offensive ROTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|Although OBJ is now a Cleveland Brown, he is arguably the most talented receiver in Giants history. His athleticism is insane, and he is more than just the guy who makes one-handed grabs. He had 4 1,000 yard receiving seasons in his 5 seasons with Big Blue.|
|4|Homer Jones *(1964-69)*|69.89|2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Homer Jones was a big play receiver, and led the NFL with 13 TD catches in 1967. Oh, and you can also thank him for the first modern TD celebration in NFL history (the spike).|
|5|Amani Toomer *(1996-2008)*|58.66|2x NFC Champ, 1x SB Champ|Toomer never was an elite WR during his time, but this ""well-dressed"" receiver was always reliable and consistent. He is Big Blue's all-time leading receiver and was an integral part of the offense in the 2000s.|

**TEs**

|1|Mark Bavaro *(1985-90)*|75.52|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowlers, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|As a phenomenal pass-catching tight end and a good blocker, Bavaro has the only season with 1,000 receiving yards by a New York Giants tight end. He was a tough player and helped the team win two SBs.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Jim Poole *(1937-41, 1945-46)*|75.5|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|A large player for his time period, Poole was a solid receiver and was a strong blocker on offense. He helped the Giants win the 1938 NFL Championship by blocking two punts.|
|3|Jeremy Shockey *(2002-07)*|72.71|1x NFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|He was no Mark Bavaro, but Shockey was a great pass-catching TE. He was arguably a top 3 TE before he got injured in Week 15 of 2007, a few weeks before the Giants beat the 18-0 Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.|

**OL**

|LT1|Rosey Brown *(1953-65)*|175.92|6 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 9x Pro Bowler, 8x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|A tremendous blocker and 8-time 1st Team All-Pro, Rosey Brown started at left tackle for all 13 seasons with the Giants. Frank Gifford gives Brown credit for helping him win the NFL MVP in 1956.|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LT2|Frank Cope *(1938-47)*|86.5|5 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro|Not only was Frank Cope a solid offensive tackle, but he was tremendous at blocking punts. He was so good at blocking them that he managed to block 6 punts in a 13-game span. Crazy!|
|LG1|Chris Snee *(2004-13)*|107.21|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, x2 1st Team All-Pro, x1 2nd Team All-Pro|A reliable and versatile offensive lineman and Giants lifer, Snee blocked for Tiki Barber, Brandon Jacobs, and Eli Manning.|
|LG2|David Diehl *(2003-13)*|69.39|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Another versatile offensive lineman, Diehl, with Snee and O'Hara, blocked for Tiki Barber, Brandon Jacobs, and Eli Manning. Another Giants lifer and Super Bowl champ.|
|C1|Mel Hein *(1931-45)*|190.5|7 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x NFL MVP, 4x Pro Bowler, 8x 1st Team All-Pro, 5x 2nd Team All-Pro|Mel Hein, in my opinion, is the greatest two-way player in NFL History. He was the NFL's ultimate iron man during his fifteen-year career with the Giants. He played both center and linebacker, and never missed a game. He was a great blocker and tackler, winning the 1938 NFL MVP and led them to a championship that year. He was one of the best players in the NFL at his time and was overshadowed by the likes of Don Hutson and Bronko Nagurski.|
|C2|Ray Wietecha *(1953-62)*|105.17|5 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 5x 2nd Team All-Pro|Wietecha was not the strongest or biggest guy on the field, but he was an exceptional leader on a stout Giants offensive line in the 1950s. He was not only a formidable center but also a great long snapper.|
|RG1|Jack Stroud *(1953-64)*|104.8|6 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 6x 2nd Team All-Pro|Stroud was a great player on the right side of the offensive line and was a really strong player on the team. He was a Giants team captain, too.|
|RG2|Len Younce *(1941, 1943-44, 1946-48)*|74.5|3 Championship Games, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Younce was a solid run blocker on a 1940s Giants offensive line. He could also play linebacker and could also punt the ball very well.|
|RT1|Ray Flaherty *(1928-35)*|83|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 3rd Team All-Pro|Flaherty could do it all. He could play tackle and end and even led the NFL in receiving in 1932. The Giants would not have won the NFL Championship in 1934 if Flaherty hadn't suggested the team switch to sneakers in the second half of the game.|

|1|Michael Strahan *(1993-2007)*|177.35|2x NFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 7x Pro Bowler, 1x Defensive POTY, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 2x Stat Leader|Michael Strahan was easily the best pass-rusher of his time. He is in the Top 5 in Career Sacks with 141.5 and also holds the record for most sacks in a season with 22.5. Later on, he became a great leader and helped the team in his final season to upset the Patriots in Super Bowl XLII.|

|2|Andy Robustelli *(1956-64)*|143.4|6 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Bert Bell Award|Robustelli was the anchor of a stout early 1960s Giants defense and was a legit pass rusher for his time. He also ""played the role"" of Ray Flaherty in the 1956 Championship Game as he gave the entire team sneakers and led them to a World Championship.|
|3|Justin Tuck *(2005-13)*|87.81|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|A solid pass rusher, Tuck record several double-digit sack seasons. He was also successful against the run. He also played a key role in Big Blue's two Super Bowl runs this millennium.|
|4|Osi Umenyiora *(2003-12)*|84.06|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Another legit Big Blue pass rusher, Osi was a sack machine including getting six sacks in one game. In addition, he was the only Pro Bowler on the 2007 Super Bowl Champion Giants.|
|5|Leonard Marshall *(1983-92)*|82.38|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|Another great pass-rusher, Leonard Marshall had 83.5 sacks with the Giants. Although a significant player on those stout Giants defenses in the 80s, he was the second best defender on the 1986 Super Bowl team behind L.T.|
|6|Red Badgro *(1930-35)*|64|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Badgro was a solid player and leader in the 1930s who could defend the line of scrimmage and make big plays as a solid end. He also excelled at blocking as well.|

He was a great counterpart to Robustelli and excelled at rushing the passer as a solid defensive end and tackle with 96.5 sacks unofficially.|

|2|Rosey Grier *(1955-62)*|80.12|5 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro|He was a giant player during his time and a very excellent defensive tackle in the 1950s. He, not only dominated the run but also crushed the offensive linemen.|
|3|Arnie Weinmeister *(1950-53)*|70.5|4x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro|Arnie was one of the scariest players in Giants history and would easily be the first defensive tackle had he played more than four years. He could rush the passer and stuff the run.|

**MLBs**

|1|Harry Carson *(1976-88)*|149|1x NFC Champ, 1x SB Champ, 9x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 4x 2nd Team All-Pro|A stout player in the Crunch Bunch and the Big Blue Wrecking Crew, Carson was a great tackler and player against the run. He had 20 solo tackles in one game and was one of the best middle linebackers of his era.|

He revolutionized the outside linebacker position and changed the Giants franchise forever. He won Defensive POTY in his rookie season and was part of the Big Blue Wrecking Crew. Heck, L.T. was a wrecking crew by himself. He made a fool out of offensive linemen by completely blowing by them and was the most recent defensive player to win the NFL MVP. He, not only blew by offensive linemen but he crushed quarterbacks! He was a scary pass-rusher with 142.5 sacks unofficially.|

|4|Carl Banks *(1984-92)*|71.87|2x NFC Champ, 2x SB Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|Banks played across from L.T. and was a solid linebacker and tackler, leading the team in tackles in the 1986 season. He was also pretty good in pass coverage.|
|5|Brad Van Pelt *(1973-83)*|68.86|5x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Part of the Crunch Bunch, Van Pelt was overshadowed by other great Giants LBs because he only made it to the playoffs once with them. However, he was a solid linebacker who could play both on the outside and the inside.|

**CBs**

|1|Mark Haynes *(1980-85)*|92.15|3x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Haynes had a solid peak and was one of the premier cornerbacks of his time. He is overshadowed among all-time great Giants defenders because he got traded before the team won the Super Bowl in 1986.|

He has the longest TD in Giants history with a pick-six that went 102 yards.|
|3|Dick Lynch *(1959-66)*|71.9|4 Championship Games, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Lynch was an elite cornerback, leading the league in picks twice. Although he was excellent in man-to-man coverage, he could only muster one Pro Bowl selection.|

In addition, he also was an exceptional tackler, return specialist and a key part of the 1956 Giants championship squad. He was also the first African-African in Giants history and in the Pro Football HOF.|

|4|Spider Lockhart *(1965-75)*|53.08|2x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|Lockhart joined the team after their core in the early '60s was gone, but he was really good at tackling and hitting.|

**Summary:**

Overall, this is one of the best All-Time teams among all 32 of the NFL's franchises. Under the offense of the great Vince Lombardi and a solid offensive line with Mel Hein and Rosey Brown, Eli Manning will be solid. He will have Frank Gifford who can run with and catch the ball, as well as some solid receivers like Rote, Shofner, and the pass-catching Mark Bavaro. The Giants are LOADED on defense with the only position they aren't really great at is the cornerback position. A front seven with Strahan, Robustelli, Katcavage, Carson, Huff, Hein, and the mighty L.T. is just terrifying. No opposing All-Time offense would want to go up against that (maybe except the Packers, but we'll see). They also have safeties Jimmy Patton and Emlen Tunnell catching some picks from quarterbacks. Their special teams is decent, but holy sh\*t. What a squad that is.

46 of the 53 players made at least one Pro Bowl during their tenure with 45 of those making at least one All-Pro team with the New York Giants. Six of the seven players who never made a Pro Bowl with the Giants have made an All-Pro team with the Giants with the exception of Amani Toomer. Phil Simms, Y.A. Tittle, Frank Gifford, Mel Hein, and Lawrence Taylor have all won an NFL MVP. The Giants have also had two players win Defensive Player of the Year with Strahan and the aforementioned L.T., who won the award three times.

Anyways, that is it for the All-Time New York Giants. Tomorrow, u/JaguarGator9 will post the All-Time Jacksonville Jaguars for you all.

317,"A genuine question about the Josh Rosen situation
I've been trying to follow most of the NFL news the last few weeks but its been busy. Not too long ago the general consensus was that the Cardinals were smoke screening and not actually considering trading Rosen. It seems in the last week or so it's a forgone conclusion that he will be traded and Washington is the front runner to land him. Did some conclusive information regarding that situation come out that I missed or is this just more rumors picking up steam?

I tried to search bar it but due to the amount of Rosen posts it's very difficult to determine which sources are reputable and which aren't so I was hoping someone may have some insight if there has been a tangibles development in the situation?",nfl

# Breakdown
I don’t think I have ever seen the potential first quarterback taken off the board be this overshadowed since Andrew Luck’s Pro Bowl snub last year. Dwayne Haskins had a record-breaking season at Ohio State in 2018, shattering many Buckeye and Big Ten records. His 50 touchdown passes were the most by any college QB since Sam “Made of Glass” Bradford in 2008 and he did it in the defensive B1G conference. 

&amp;nbsp;

It always looks like Haskins has been drawing the short stick throughout his career. Even with his record-breaking year, he finished third in the Heisman race behind Kyler Murray and Tua Tagovailoa. With Justin Herbert deciding to return to Oregon his senior year, it looked as if Haskins would be the undisputed #1 quarterback off the board but then he found himself in the shadows of Oklahoma’s Kyler Murray once again. Now we know how Adrian Peterson on the Bears felt like. Remember that guy? Yeah neither do many others.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
With Haskins thriving in the B1G conference and carving up many top defenses along the way, there are a lot of question marks regarding the Ohio State quarterback. Is Haskins the QB that everyone should actually be paying attention to or is there a reason people are overlooking him?
 
# Strengths

I want to address the elephant in the room. It may be because I watched over 20 hours of film on Dwayne Haskins and I was able to dive deep into the different layers of his game, but I am confidently able to state that he is of the African American descent. Please disregard any preconceived notions that you attach to black quarterbacks because I can assure you that Dwayne Haskins breaks that mold. Don’t listen to Stephen A Smith when he says Haskins is more of a [runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbu4ijQ3dGw). Actually, better advice is to *never* listen to Stephen A Smith. I’d trust Tyreek to babysit more than anything that came out of Stephen A’s mouth.^toosoon?
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Haskins is the prototypical pocket passer who enjoys utilizing short passes to dissect the defense. His bread and butter come from making quick reads and getting the ball out of his hands swiftly. The amount of slants and drags Haskins made last season is ridiculous. I usually watch about 15-20 hours of film on each prospect before their breakdown and let me tell you, this was one of the most difficult analysis because it was so boring. Don’t get me wrong, Haskins’ excelled at the system Ohio State set up for him, but after watching around 15 slants a game, it was difficult to tell if I was watching Haskins or Eli Manning. 

##West Coast System

Haskins is the perfect West Coast quarterback. It plays to all his strengths and you can see how efficient he can be because that’s exactly what Ohio State utilized him. He has fantastic ball placement with short to intermediate passes and it’s a misconception that all quarterbacks can throw short well. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
There is a difference with being able to dink and dunk and being a special west coast signal caller. If you look at this [play](https://imgur.com/BO9XhSd), it just looks like an easy slant completion, but the placement of the ball allows his receiver to catch it in stride and get the YAC. It is easier to tell from this [angle]( https://imgur.com/7THRvEh) how Haskins is effortlessly able to lead his receiver to gain all those extra yards after the catch. 
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
He has consistently shown that he can [place]( https://imgur.com/xrV0wql) the ball perfectly on these slant/drag routes to give his playmakers a chance to break it big. Players like Golden Tate, JuJu, and Odell would fit Haskins’ playstyle very well as they dominate after the catch and create great separation. But then again, who wouldn’t do well with those receivers? It’s not like an organization would have liked one of them so much to trade for them midseason and then not utilize them well throughout the rest of the year…right?^killme
 

##Football IQ
 
Haskins’ biggest strength is easily his ability to read the defense and progress through his options. Because Haskin is not the most athletic, he has to find other ways to beat a defense and he does it with his eyes. [Look](https://imgur.com/P9XPFJ6) at the way he starts on the right side of the field and makes his way back across the field. Whether he progressed through his reads or he was looking off the safety, it was deliberate and brilliant. [This](https://imgur.com/PgFXmAC) angle not only shows the progression more clearly, but the way he maneuvers around the pocket is exactly what you’re looking for.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
[Here](https://imgur.com/mCuB6WA) is even a better example of Haskins’ ability to progress through his reads. It’s 2nd and 14 and he has plenty of time and he takes advantage of the lack of pass rush Northwestern is able to generate. He goes from left to right and scans until he finds his third option and hits him with a beautiful ball. It’s rare to see a young quarterback to have the patience and intelligence to get through his reads and make the correct decision. His football IQ helps him get that little extra advantage amongst the rest of the class. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Although a majority of defensive looks Ohio State saw was man to man, there were many different zone coverages that Haskins faced as well. Although he doesn’t have a lot of experience with zone concepts, he responded relatively well. [Zone](https://imgur.com/PaI2QDz) coverage presents a different type of windows and timing with his receivers but he is still able to fit the ball into the tight areas. We already know how Haskins tears apart man-to-man, but it’s nice to see that he is able to identify the soft spots in a zone defense and fit it into the tight windows while giving his playmakers a chance to get some YAC.

##Arm
 
Haskins may not have the juice that Favre or Mahomes bring to the table, he can still [rip](https://imgur.com/ROBYye7) it when he needs to. He has enough arm strength to make all the throws and the good news is, I believe he is holding himself back (I’ll get to this later). 

&amp;nbsp;

[This](https://imgur.com/XSNvJdt) play shows off all the strengths Dwayne Haskins has. He goes through his reads and as soon as he finds his open receiver, he doesn’t hesitate and lets it go. He [looks](https://imgur.com/OnAbgLa) off the safety by starting his read to his left and then launches a great pass for one of his 50 touchdowns last season. Although he rarely threw the ball down the field, he showed that he was capable of doing so.

&amp;nbsp;

[This](https://imgur.com/8TPNePU) play right here shows the potential he has. He shows great touch on this [pass](https://imgur.com/t0OtoVs) and if he continues to work on his confidence on the long ball, he should be able to add this skill to his arsenal. Not being a one dimensional helps his case at being the top quarterback prospect in this class.
 
##Deceptive “Speed”

This by all mean does not mean he is fast because he’s slower than the Bengals’ realizing that Marvin Lewis was not the answer. Remember, he is a pocket passer but he has shown that he has a bit more wiggle than Kirk Cousins or Josh “Stone Feet” Rosen (check out my write up on Rosen from last year). [This](https://imgur.com/GzB5zMN) play makes him look like Big Ben but this is more of an exception than the norm with him. He can get out of trouble on occasion with his feet when he needs to even though he’s not overly athletic. He looks like he’s running in slow motion but it just works. Very reminiscent of Joe [“White Lightning”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f192tWhSE0I) Flacco.
 
# Weaknesses

While I believe that Dwayne Haskins would make a fantastic West Coast Pocket Passer, there are numerous concerns that come up with him. I know one of his biggest concerns many critics bring up is how he was a full-time starter for only one season. People tend to want a bigger sample size and some GMs won’t even consider taking a quarterback if they don’t have multiple seasons as a starter under their belt. Bill Parcells’ now famous scouting notes included the following for a QB prospect:
-Be a three-year starter
-Be a senior
-Start 30 games
-Win at least 23 games
-Post a 2:1 TD to INT ratio
-Complete at least 60% of passes

If we were following Parcells’ rules, the only “top” candidates would be Ryan Finley from NC State and Brett Rypien this year. Although it’s an old-school mentality, the last class of quarterbacks that would have qualified was Baker Mayfield and Mason Rudolph and Baker was a ROPY candidate so maybe there is a method to his madness.

&amp;nbsp;

I am not that particular when it comes to quarterback experience, but I would prefer a bit more than just one season. With Trubisky looking promising, it’s easy to see why GMs are willing to overlook the lack of starting experience but it is definitely something to note. The list of successful quarterbacks with such little starting experience is shorter than a coach’s wait time to be interviewed after they mention that they have sniffed the seat that McVay sat in 4th grade. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Footwork
 
For a pocket passer, you’d expect Haskins to have decent footwork, but you’d be wrong. Like really wrong. Like more wrong than Antonio Cromartie’s doctor telling him his vasectomy would work. The more hours of film I sunk into Haskins, the more infuriated I became with how terrible his basic mechanics were. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

Quarterbacks generate most of their power from their legs when they drive the ball. If you ever wondered what a vegetable would look like throwing a football, look no further. Haskins has a bad tendency of throwing with just his [arm](https://imgur.com/ruNnU5J). He doesn’t set his feet often and it often results in inconsistencies.

&amp;nbsp:

I believe that his bad habit of just “arming” his throws can be fixed, but he has become [reliant]( https://imgur.com/U92RVFr) on it to the point where it’s second nature to him. This throw looks special and similar to what Aaron Rodgers does every week but Rodgers has a truly special arm whereas I don’t believe Haskins will be able to get away with it at the next level.

&amp;nbsp;

Not only does Haskins tend to “arm” a lot of his throws, but he gets very lazy with his footwork as well. He has plenty of space to [step up]( https://imgur.com/7gJ0poJ) here but he just slings it. Granted, this was an easy completion but I am looking more at his mechanic rather than the end result. [Here]( https://imgur.com/MYbsUp1) is another example where he has very lazy footwork. He throws off his back foot instead of stepping into it. If he led this ball in front and outside, he could have given his receiver a better opportunity rather than almost a pick. If he throws this in the NFL, Patrick Peterson will be sending gift baskets to the NFL schedulers to face him more often. 

##Inconsistent Long Ball
 
Ohio States’ West Coast offense was a blessing and a curse for Dwayne. Although he broke records and showed the world what he can do in an offense he is comfortable in, he also showed how he got too content with the short-intermediate pass routes. He was very inconsistent when he had to drive the ball down the field and showed a lack of touch.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
He left a lot of [big](https://imgur.com/KvlXkYh) plays on the field. He would constantly overthrow, sail, and blow chances at throws longer than 15 yards. That’s why I am not as harsh when evaluating Parris Campbell and other speedsters coming out of Ohio State this year because they were not utilized correctly.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Many of his long throws that would [sail](https://imgur.com/KI7PGkZ) can all be traced back to his terrible footwork. He has space to step up and drive the ball down but instead, he just lacks the fundamentals to deliver a consistent deep ball. It’s almost as if his legs and his arms have a mind of its own. All good west coast quarterbacks are great at lulling a defense to sleep with short passes but require the skill to blow one over the top when the opportunity presents itself but with the way he [fails](https://imgur.com/Hje78sc) repeatedly in attempting long passes, he will improve before starting for an NFL team. He has shown signs of inconsistencies at [intermediate](https://imgur.com/Fu5QuXv) passes where his fundamentals breakdown as well.

##Under Pressure
 
Like most college pocket passers, Haskins’ decision making is questionable under pressure. Because he does not possess great athleticism, he gets in trouble if a team pressures him when he is not prepared for it. He may [believe](https://imgur.com/A3iHBDj) he’s more athletic than he is, just like the Cowboys genuinely believe that bringing 36-year-old Jason Witten out of retirement is the best way to help their tight end position. He has no [excuse](https://imgur.com/IxKHxjK) for sailing this ball. There are other [questionable](https://imgur.com/KuW3JHW) decisions that make Jameis “Fuck It Chuck It” Winston look good.

&amp;nbsp;

##Shotgun

Just like I stated with Murray and many other college quarterback prospects, Haskins took a majority of his snaps from the shotgun. Normally this doesn’t impact my view on a quarterback, but Haskins’ lack of footwork and his poor fundamentals present a concern. Because he has high football IQ, I’m sure he will be able to fix this issue quickly with his future quarterback coach, but it is something I always like to mention. 

&amp;nbsp;
  
# Player Comparison
I mentioned it a bit before but the player I kept thinking about when watching all those hours of film was Eli Manning. They have similar measurables and even similar 40 times. Imagine being a young, future quarterback knowing that Eli Manning has a faster 40 time than you. I don’t even know if you can recover from that.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
In all seriousness, Eli was much more polished coming out of the University of Mississippi, but an argument could be made that Dwayne could have looked just as good if he decided to stay and continue to develop at Ohio State. Eli has always excelled at the short to intermediate passing game and had questionable decision making throw down the field which matches Haskins to a T. Wait, has anyone seen Eli and Haskins in a room together? This [photo](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/eli-manning.jpg) has recently been released that support my claim.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
# Recap
Haskins was talked about as the number 1 quarterback in this draft class until Kyler Murray announced that he was going to pursue football instead of baseball and then Dwayne fell out of relevance. Although they both play the same position, they play completely different roles. Dwayne can develop into a surgical quarterback that can frustrate defenses and become a solid starter for years to come. He has a lack of starting experience but that could be viewed as both positive and negative. He still has a great opportunity for huge growth, or he may not be as good as advertised and just put together one good campaign. If he can get to a team that utilizes a west coast system and has a good offensive line, he can be the best QB in the class but is he worth the risk?

Hey r/NFL! In seeing all the AB posts recently, I thought of sharing what I believe to be the main reason behind AB's outbursts and demands. I don't think he's a narcissist, or has one too many TBIs. Here's my review of some quotes and issues throughout the year that explain it. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - AB's issue is that he always saw himself, Ben and LeVeon as the leaders of the team. Ben has started to see himself as the unquestioned leader of the team, on par with the coach and leadership; in doing so, he's created distance between himself and AB, as well as Bell, coming out in the media and being critical of them as if they're just ""one of the team."" The preferential treatment of AB as Steelers royalty began to draw to a close, and AB never wanted to be ""just one of the guys"", as he felt his work ethic and talent separated him from the rest of the team and made him part of the leadership, in the same way that Ben feels that being the QB of a super bowl winning team makes him beyond reproach. Every time the team even slightly looks at AB as anything less than the greatest WR to ever play for them, AB goes haywire, as he's spent the entire season feeling under appreciated, as if he doesn't need to be there. The week 17 issue and then being told by Tomlin that, ""he didn't need to be there"" was the last straw. That's why he wanted to be traded, why he wanted more money (money = valuation to him) and why he's still sour over how things ended in Pittsburgh.

&amp;#x200B;

**Early Season Issues:**

My belief is that the original issue started right here: [https://twitter.com/Scarpizio/status/1041444635720253442](https://twitter.com/Scarpizio/status/1041444635720253442)

&amp;#x200B;

At the time that this tweet was posted, Lev Bell was the main source of the ire from the Steelers organization. This came up as yet another issue that the Steelers were having, but was quickly downplayed by the Steelers and ultimately the team returned their focus quickly on Lev Bell. However, the important part about this tweet is that it came from someone who was well known to AB - the person who originally made the tweet worked for the Steelers organization for 7 years as a PR person and was in constant contact with the players.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/antonio-brown-fires-back-ex-steelers-pr-guy-trade-me-tweet](https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/49ers/antonio-brown-fires-back-ex-steelers-pr-guy-trade-me-tweet)

&amp;#x200B;

I think this is where the issue starts - by having someone known to the team (and more importantly, aware of the dynamics of the team as well as personally known to AB and Ben) make an explicit comment that Ben made AB. It's well known that the Steelers organization and fanbase are incredibly loyal to the QB and the leadership of the team - perhaps after the now infamous ""trade me, let's find out"" tweet, AB realized that it wasn't just some random staffer with an isolated opinion - other people thought this too, including Ben.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mid Season Issues:**

Ben Rothlisberger, Week 12:

During his radio show, he notes that AB failed to run a ""flat"" route over the middle. According to Ben R, this led to an interception. Here's the [play](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1066850696157265931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1066850696157265931&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.12up.com%2Fposts%2F6231808-video-big-ben-tosses-horrendous-int-at-goal-line-to-blow-it-for-steelers).

&amp;#x200B;

At about 2 seconds, it's clear that AB is running a slant rather than a flat - but that the flat is completely covered by the DT Shelby Harris, and that running a clean flat likely would have brought AB into a collision course with the tackle. Instead of reading the situation, Ben makes a poor call and forces it to AB, completely missing that Harris was directly in his throwing lane. The issue isn't the pass though - it's the fact that Ben turned the ball over on the goal line with 1 min left in a must score situation, and then blamed it on AB.

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of the comments, AB had this to say about the criticism: [Source](https://247sports.com/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers/Article/Antonio-Brown-Ben-Roethlisberger-criticism-no-issue-125630140/)

""We have the relationship where we can challenge each other. We can encourage each other. That’s the relationship that you want to have with your quarterback.""

&amp;#x200B;

But then Ben was quoted as saying: [Source](https://archive.triblive.com/sports/steelers/steelers-ben-roethlisberger-questions-late-play-calling/)

""The Steelers quarterback wanted the final series of plays to focus on wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who had 13 catches for 189 yards, including a 97-yard catch-and-run for a score.

“I think we should have went to him four straight plays,” Roethlisberger said.

&amp;#x200B;

Ben goes onto say, ""No, it feels like we have a bunch of number one receivers,"" Big Ben responded. ""I’d put **James Conner** in there. **Vance McDonald**, Switz \[**Ryan Switzer**\], Ju, A.B."" [Source](https://247sports.com/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers/Article/Ben-Roethlisberger-No-1-receiver-JuJu-Smith-Schuster-Antonio-Brown-125558019/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Late Season Issues:**

A few weeks later, in Week 17, this happened: [Source](https://archive.triblive.com/sports/steelers/steelers-ben-roethlisberger-questions-late-play-calling/)

&amp;#x200B;

""Brown left a walk-through the next week after the Steelers wanted to run a hot read again and sent another player into the lineup, a source close to the situation told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Brown talked with Roethlisberger afterward, telling the quarterback he felt underappreciated...""

&amp;#x200B;

More insight into that situation here, according to former Packer turned NFL analyst James Jones: [Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/12/31/18163364/antonio-brown-steelers-ben-roethlisberger-drama-locker-room-fight-injury)

“I’ve been told in meetings \[Roethlisberger\] would take shots at AB. Like, ‘I don’t got to throw you the ball,’ and things like that. Wednesday in practice, I heard he ran the wrong route, Big Ben threw the ball on the ground, said, ‘Get him out of here. Get somebody else in there.""

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the last week, AB doesn't play. Here's some quotes from both AB and the organization around that:

Tomlin: [Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/12/31/18163364/antonio-brown-steelers-ben-roethlisberger-drama-locker-room-fight-injury)

""Tomlin said the wide receiver “expressed soreness in his lower body” on Wednesday, specifically his feet, ankle, and knee. On Thursday and Friday, Brown was still experiencing discomfort, so he was placed on the injury report and then was sent to get an MRI...Tomlin said that Brown did not communicate with him on Friday evening and Saturday, as expected. It wasn’t until Sunday morning, when Brown’s agent Drew Rosenhaus reached out to Tomlin to let him know Brown was feeling better, that the team had any updates about Brown.

At that point, Tomlin told Brown that “the best thing was to be there and support his teammates.”

&amp;#x200B;

AB: [Source](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2018/12/31/18163364/antonio-brown-steelers-ben-roethlisberger-drama-locker-room-fight-injury)

“I’m a little banged up so I meet with coach Tomlin and I’m telling him, ‘Hey man I’m banged up so I’m gonna need some time to get right,’ and he was like, ‘If you’re banged up, you can just go home’,” Brown said. “Like you ain’t even gotta be here, so I’m like ‘Damn, that’s where we’re at?’

&amp;#x200B;

“I’m going to war for these guys, putting my life on the line but it’s an unknown when it comes to me just like right now with the write-ups.""

&amp;#x200B;

“All year dude called me out. We’d lose a game and he’d be like, ‘AB should have ran a better route’,” Brown said. “That’s the type of guy he is. **He feels like he’s the owner**. **Bro, you threw that shit to the D-line, how the fuck am I running a bad route? You need to give me a better ball.**” \[Sound familiar? Check the Week 12 notes above\]

&amp;#x200B;

To sum up: after a year that started with AB questioning whether the team around him, from the ownership down to the players believed that Ben was entirely responsible for his success, AB starts to become hypersensitive to every situation that involves Ben. Specifically, he takes issue with the notion that he and Ben are not equals, and takes further issue with the idea that he's on the same level as Juju, or any other player for the organization. In his mind, it's him, Ben and perhaps LeVeon - whereas in Ben's mind, it seems to be ownership &amp; him, and then everyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

To phrase it another way, AB's concern is that he sees Ben in the same way that Ben views senior leadership. And although Ben has received inclusion into that club, from those same folks (the infamous Ben has 53 kids quote), Ben hasn't included AB in that same way. The more that Ben sees himself as part of that leadership club, the more he distances himself from AB, and the more AB (and to an extent, LevBell) gets aggravated that he's being diminished.

&amp;#x200B;

FWIW, here's LeVeon echoing the same sentiments, unrelated to AB: [Source](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/leveon-bell-ben-was-a-factor-in-rb-leaving-steelers-reveals-how-close-he-came-to-signing-deal/)

""Quarterbacks are leaders; it is what it is,"" Bell said. But ""you're still a teammate at the end of the day. You're not Kevin Colbert. You're not \[team president Art\] Rooney. The organization wants to win. \[Coach Mike\] Tomlin wants to win. Ben wants to win — but Ben wants to win *his* way, and that's tough to play with,"" Bell explained. ""Ben won a Super Bowl, but he won when he was younger. Now he's at this stage where he tries to control everything, and \[the team\] let him get there.""",nfl

360,"Why is Matt Ryan hated so much?
It’s not as prevalent on Reddit although it’s still here but on twitter specifically, any QB list with Ryan in the top 5 or top 10 gets tons of backlash. Obviously I believe he is top 5-7 and I think stats support that but very little non Falcons fans agree with it (even Some Falcons fans hate him) and some non falcons fans even fully hate him. 

Does anyone have any theories as to why he seems to be hated so much? It’s not only by casual fans either. People like Freeman (obvious bias), La Canfora, even other players like Jalen Ramsey and the players the Athletic polled think he’s overrated (which imo is impossible for a player that is a top QB but is rarely on top QB lists)

My theories:
A: His team choked on the biggest stage and casual fans blame the QBs for everything so people view him as that only and can’t see anything else he’s done. 

B: he isn’t eccentric. He’s never in the headlines, never celebrating first downs like Rivers and Newton, etc. he’s just bland. 

C; he’s only been the best QB in the league once and despite being near the top other years, people only think he has one good season

D: people fail to understand that a player can be a great QB with a great WR and having that weapon doesn’t take away from his skills

I’m just having trouble understanding why there’s so much backlash to anyone that dare give him credit. [This is just one of the tweets that gave me the idea for this post ](https://twitter.com/allbrightnfl/status/1115408673273274369?s=21)",nfl

373,"Josh Jacobs is not a first round running back
*\*Disclaimer: I am not commenting on how good I believe Josh Jacobs will be in the NFL. This write-up is only about his draft stock.*

&amp;#x200B;

Running backs have been flying off the board on the first day of the draft recently. Since 2015, there have been five running backs taken in the top-10 and eight in the first round overall.

That trend will end in 2019.

Not only will a running back not be selected in the top-10 for the first time in four years, but not a single back will be taken in the entire first round.

&amp;#x200B;

There are two main factors that go into consideration for teams when picking a player on draft day: production and potential. College production proves that a player’s skill set will translate to the football field in a quantifiable medium. Potential projects how a player’s raw skill set will translate to the professional level.

Josh Jacobs draft profile heavily leans toward potential over production.

Now, this isn’t a bad thing. Many collegiate players need the coaching and seasoning the NFL offers to hone their elite ability.

However, for a player to be a first round pick, production is a significant factor. Especially at a position like running back where teams expect a polished player to find immediate success.

Here is Josh Jacobs' rushing yard production over his three years at Alabama:

&amp;#x200B;

**Josh Jacobs**

2016 - 567

2017 - 284

2018 - 640

&amp;#x200B;

First round running backs since 2015 have had an even blend of production at the collegiate level and potential in the NFL to convince teams they are worthy of a first round selection.

Every running back taken in the first round in recent draft history (since 2015) has had at least two 900+ yard campaigns in college.

Let’s dive into the numbers. Below is every running back taken in the first round since 2013 and their 900+ single-season rushing yard outputs in college.

&amp;#x200B;

**2018**

**Saquon Barkley**

2015 - 1,076

2016 - 1,496

2017 - 1,271

&amp;#x200B;

**Rashaad Penny**

2016 - 1,018

2017 - 2,248

&amp;#x200B;

**Sony Michel**

2015 - 1,136

2017 - 1,227

&amp;#x200B;

**2017**

**Leonard Fournette**

2014 - 1,034

2015 - 1,953

&amp;#x200B;

**Christian McCaffrey**

2015 - 2,019

2016 - 1,603

&amp;#x200B;

**2016**

**Ezekiel Elliott**

2014 - 1,878

2015 - 1,821

&amp;#x200B;

**2015**

**Todd Gurley**

2012 - 1,385

2013 - 989

2014 - 911

&amp;#x200B;

**Melvin Gordon**

2013 - 1,609

2014 - 2,587

&amp;#x200B;

In addition to these numbers, no running back taken in the first round has rushed for less than 900 yards in a single collegiate season since John Avery in 1998. Avery was a former Ole Miss running back who was drafted 29th overall by the Dolphins.

&amp;#x200B;

**John Avery**

1996 - 788

1997 - 862

*\*Avery ended his NFL career with 524 total rushing yards*

&amp;#x200B;

It’s been 25 years (1994) since a running back selected in the first round of the NFL draft had fewer yards in his best single collegiate season than Josh Jacobs’ 640 yards as a junior. That was William Floyd out of Florida State who was selected 28th overall by the 49ers.

&amp;#x200B;

**William Floyd**

1991 - 97

1992 - 222

1993 - 321

*\*Floyd ended his NFL career with 1,141 total rushing yards*

&amp;#x200B;

Along with a lack of production, Josh Jacobs is also sub-par in his raw athletic ability.

The 40 yard dash can boost a prospects draft stock more than any other single event in the pre-draft process. It can also hurt a prospects stock and raise questions about a player’s explosiveness.

No running back taken in the first round since 2015 has run a sub-4.60 40 yard dash. Josh Jacobs ran a mid-4.60 at his pro day.

Here are the 40 times of the eight running backs taken in the first round since 2015:

&amp;#x200B;

**Saquon Barkley - 4.40**

**Rashaad Penny - 4.46**

**Sony Michel - 4.54**

**Leonard Fournette - 4.51**

**Christian McCaffrey - 4.48**

**Ezekiel Elliott - 4.46**

**Todd Gurley - DNP**

*\*it was reported that Gurley had previously been timed in the 4.30 second range*

**Melvin Gordon - 4.52**

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t to say that a poor 40 yard dash time dooms a prospect. It certainly does not. But, to be a first round running back a player must check all the boxes. This is yet another box that has been left unchecked for Josh Jacobs.

&amp;#x200B;

It’s all but unanimous that former Alabama running back Josh Jacobs is the top back by a decent margin in the 2019 draft class. Although, that does not mean he is worthy of a first round selection.

If Jacobs were to be taken in the first round of the draft this year, it would mean a team would be ignoring a historical lack of production in the 21st century.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, Josh Jacobs looks like an excellent NFL running back with the complete skill set to be a difference-maker on every down for a team. However, Jacobs does not have the complete player profile to warrant being taken in the first round.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Josh Jacobs’ significant lack of college production pales in comparison to recent first round running backs. His stock is as the RB1 in the 2019 draft class, but does not warrant a first round selection based on his collegiate statistical output.",nfl

There have been 32* “modern era” running backs enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Of these, 24* have played at least 1 season in the Super Bowl era (1966 season and onward). For the purpose of this, I wanted to only include those RBs that played the majority of their careers in the Super Bowl era. That eliminates Jim Taylor, Paul Hornung, Lenny Moore, and John Henry Johnson, bringing us to a total of 20 RBs.

\*Charley Taylor is listed as a running back, but played the majority of his career as a receiver, and thus I excluded him from this analysis. 

This is an attempt to box score scout the current HoF RBs, and to see how Frank Gore compares to them. This looks at career totals in yards and TDs for rushing and receiving, PFR's Approximate Value statistic, accolades / hardware, best single season, totals in the RBs best 3-year stretch in rushing and receiving, and averages across that stretch. Best seasons in rushing and receiving are not necessarily in the same season or stretch. I also included average and median numbers for the data set. All raw data was sourced from Pro Football Reference.

I'll start.

**NFC North**
I really hate the Packers and the Lions.  I went to a game in Minneapolis a couple years ago and the fans there were awesome.  Unfortunately, I have one Vikings fan friend who sort of ruins it for all of you.  The Bears are my favorite NFC North team.  


**NFC East**
Born and raised in Dallas.  Cowboys are my primary team.  


**NFC South**
This is kind of a hard one.  I can rule out the Saints pretty easily.  Brees is the man but there was a quasi rivalry between the Cowboys and Saints there for a little bit that still lingers.  I was a big fan of Winston when he came out of college, his lack of production and character concerns have sort of made me eat my words in that respect.  I have family in the Carolinas and attended their training camp once so that endeared a lot of their players to me, notably Kuechly, who signed autographs for at least an hour after practice.  I've always kind of like Atlanta's colors though, and their offense has been fun the last few years.  Went to their stadium last year and got a Julio jersey.  Probably a slight lead to Carolina but I do like Atlanta a lot.


**NFC West**
I have a Russel Wilson jersey, but outside of that I don't care much for Seattle.  I bought a Rams shirt last year when I was in LA.  So I guess I'll go with them.  


**AFC North**
I don't care for the Steelers.  Until recently there hasn't been much to say for the Browns.  The Bengals have a Texas QB though, and AJ Green is a fan favorite.  But I've always liked the Ravens for some reason, and this was solidified with the emergence of Zach Orr.  His time there was brief but as a UNT grad it was fun hearing about one of our own in the national spotlight.  I get the irony with the Mean Joe connections, but Orr was a guy I watched and knew in college. Ravens are my pick.  


**AFC East**
My wife's family is from Massachusetts.  So as a split Cowboys/Patriots house we are officially the worst family is sports.  I have a signed Tom Brady jersey hanging in my office next to a Witten one.  I've embraced the dark side.  


**AFC South**
I don't have a whole lot of feelings towards any of these teams I guess.  I've always liked Manning and Luck, so I suppose I'll say Colts on this one.


**AFC West**
The Chiefs have been a hell of a lot of fun to watch for awhile now.  When he was in his prime Jamaal Charles was my favorite back.  Now I get to watch Mahomes do stuff that shouldn't even be possible for a human every Sunday.  However, Anthony Lynn went to my high school.  I was there the same time as his son as a matter of fact.  So for that reason I have to cheer for the Chargers as long as he's their coach.  Shout out to the Raiders though.  I feel like there's some sort of Cowboys/Raiders connection or something for some reason, always had a soft spot for them.  ",nfl
395,"Odd Hometown Trends
I was looking at a post in the r/DenverBroncos sub and realized that my hometown of Naperville has been surprising prolific at producing serviceable NFL TEs lately. Not great, not bad, just serviceable. Specifically;

- Owen Daniels

- Cameron Brate

- James O'shaughnessy

- Matt LaCosse

There are other names in the NFL from Naperville, including at least one big name, but I just found this particular trend interesting. 

Anybody else have oddly specific trends from their hometowns?",nfl

#Atlanta Falcons History

After the building of Atlanta Fulton-County stadium, and various exhibition matches, the city of Atlanta desires a football team to call their own. After some talks, the AFL reached out to Rankin Smith, executive VP of the Life Insurance Company of Georgia, to offer him a franchise. Spurred on by the AFL’s offer the NFL was quick to also give an offer to Smith, which he ultimately took, buying the team for $8.5 million on June 30, 1965. That previously offered AFL franchise would go on to become the Dolphins. The Falcons are the 15th NFL franchise, and participating in an expansion draft in 1966. The name Falcons came from the suggestion of a schoolteacher named Julia Elliot

The Falcons got off to a rough start, only winning 12 games in its first 4 years. The team made the playoffs for the first time in 1978, winning a wild card game over the Eagles. In 1980 the Falcons reached 12-4, winning the NFC West for the first time. The team would make the playoffs a few more times in the 80s but was never able to win a game, leading to coach Leeman Bennett getting fired.  In 1992 the team moved to the newly built Georgia Dome. In 1998, under coach Dan Reeves, the Falcons became the “Dirty Birds”, reaching a 14-2 record. They upset the No.1 seeded Vikings to make their first super bowl. They lost XXXIII to the Broncos. Afterwards injuries crippled the team back to losing records. In 2001, the team made a deal with Arthur Blank to buy the team off of Taylor Smith (Rankin’s son) the Falcons made a trade with the Chargers to get the first overall pick, which they used to draft Michael Vick, who lead the falcons back to a playoff berth. In 2003 however, Vick broke his leg, and Dan Reeves was fired. Under new head coach Jim Mora, the Falcons would make the playoffs 2004, losing to the eagles in the NFC championship. After failing get another winning season, Mora was dismissed and Bobby Petrino was hired. Before the 2007 season, Vick was suspended indefinitely, and during the season Petrino resigned without notice, the franchise reached rock bottom. Fuck Bobby Petrino. In 2008 the Falcons hires Mike Smith and drafted Matt Ryan, setting the franchise on a new course. Under those two, the Falcons enjoyed the it most prosperous stretch in history, making the playoffs many times, but they had a poor record in the playoffs, capped off by a devastating loss to the 49ers in the 2012 NFC Championship. Mike Smith only won 1 playoff game. After this two seasons of losing records, Mike Smith was fired, and Dan Quinn was hired. In his second year Quinn, partnered with OC Kyle Shanahan, lead the Falcons to a 11-5 record and a historic offense. The team stormed through the playoffs to reach Super Bowl LI. Unfortunately the Super Bowl was canceled that year so nobody knows what could’ve happen. After this the team has gradually decreased in record to 7-9 where they sit now. 

#The All-Time Players 

#[Here’s a graphic I made with all the players and their stats](https://imgur.com/a/1XWCD2k)
^(plz look at it)

Before I go over the players, I’ll share my methodology for picking them.
 
I tried to find a way to pick the players without any bias and recency bias, which is especially important since a majority of the players in Falcons history were before my time as a fan. Additionally, I wanted to find a way to compare players without matching stats head to head. While H2H sounds good in theory, the changes in the game of football over time makes this kind of comparison somewhat unfair. To help with this, I used Pro Football References, “Approximate Value” as a way to simply find out how good/important a player was to the team given the times.  And finally, I wanted to find a balance between playing time and accolades/accomplishments. I wanted to award both the long-time players and the elite players, so I came to this (admittedly simple) equation.
 
**Approximated Value * (Games Played/10) * Multipliers**

The multipliers are: Pro bowl (x3), RotY (x3), All-Pro (x4), O/DPoY (x5), MVP (x10), Hall of Fame (x15)

This equation would get me an “All-time Value” without further ado here are my rankings based on this methodology (in order left to right). 

**QB:** Matt Ryan, Steve Bartkowski, Michael Vick

**RB:** Michael Turner, William Andrews, Jamal Anderson 

**WR:** Julio Jones, Roddy White, Andre Rison

**TE:** Tony Gonzalez, Alge Crumpler

**C:** Jeff Van Note, Todd McClure, Alex Mack

**T:** Mike Kenn, Bob Whitfield, Tyson Clabo

**G:** Bill Fralic, R.C. Thielemann, Justin Blalock

**DT:** Jonathan Babineaux, Travis Hall, Mike Lewis

**DE:** Claude Humphrey, John Abraham, Patrick Kerney

 **S:** Scott Case, Thomas DeCoud, Tom Pridemore

**LB:** Tommy Nobis, Jessie Teggle, Keith Brooking

**CB:** Deion Sanders, Rolland Lawrence, Bobby Butler (he’s labeled wrong on the graphic)

**K:** Morten Anderson, Matt Bryant

406,"Packers tight end Marcedes Lewis asked who the best TE in the league is: ""I think it's Travis Kelce, no question about it.”
http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001025559/article/marcedes-lewis-no-question-travis-kelce-is-nfls-best-te

&gt;""I just think that the way he's used, from his route-running to his football IQ, he just does a really good job for them,"" Lewis explained as to why Kelce is the top TE. ""He knows how to find the spots in the zones to do what he has to do to get the ball. Great ball skills. He's a willing blocker, obviously he's not down there pancaking guys every single play, but he'll get nasty if he has to be and he's definitely a leader on that team.""

&gt;""Obviously with a guy like Patrick Maholmes he can make every throw inside and outside of the pocket,"" Lewis said. ""Normally when you have a a quarterback that can move around and run like he does, that's normally good for the tight end. We're normally the safety valve. If things don't work with the first and second read, if we're not primary on that play, the ball has a good chance at coming to us. We've seen examples of that time and time again.""

&gt;Kelce has simply been outstanding over the last three seasons, hauling in 80 or greater catches and 1,000 or more yards every year in that span. His 2018 tour de force was a career-high triple crown with 103 receptions for 1,336 yards and 10 touchdowns.

&gt;As aforementioned, Kelce's 1,336 yards were briefly an NFL record and are now second all-time in league lore. Hence, the yards are the most in a single season by a tight end for the Chiefs franchise and his 103 catches are as well, achievements all the more impressive considering Tony Gonzalez was a Chief and he's headed to the Hall of Fame later this year.",nfl

442,"32 All-Time Teams/32 Days: The Philadelphia Eagles All-Time 53 Man Roster
Hello r/nfl, and welcome to the 32 All-Time Teams in 32 Days for the Philadelphia Eagles. My job was to build an all-time 53-man roster for one of the most historic franchises in the NFL and that is what I present you today. Making this list was difficult, took a ton of research and a lot of time. I have learned a lot, but I am sure I am not perfect here. I tried to account for many things when evaluating players like performance, leadership, accomplishments and how beloved the players were by fans. But it is possible your favorite player got left off the list.

So let’s get into it, the Philadelphia Eagles All-Time 53-Man Roster:


**Quarter backs:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Nick Foles|2012-2014, 2017-2018
Donovan McNabb|1999-2009
Randall Cunningham|1985-1999

Let’s get this out of the way right now: Nick Foles is the greatest quarterback in Eagles’ history. It’s not that he did what no one else ever could in bringing a Super Bowl to Philadelphia, it was the way he did it. Nick Foles’ 2018 playoff run was not short of incredible. His performance in the Super Bowl was one of the best of all time while defeating a guy who was having one of the best offensive performances of all time. You add to his prior track record, throwing 27 touchdowns to just two interceptions in one season, and tossing seven touchdowns in a game against the Raiders, and it is no doubt he is number one. And that is no disrespect to Donovan McNabb. McNabb was a perennial MVP-candidate during his eleven years in Philadelphia and led the team during one of its most successful eras ever. McNabb’s number five is retired by the Eagles and he leads the team in quarterback wins, completions, passing touchdowns and passing yards. Randall Cunningham takes the final spot here. Cunningham played for the Eagles for eleven years and is one of the best athletes at the quarterback position of all time.


**Running backs:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Steve Van Buren|1944-1951
Brian Westbrook|2002-2009
LeSean McCoy|2009-2014
Wilbert Montgomery|1977-1984

Running back may arguably be the Eagles’ deepest position. I feel sorry for any defense that has to stop this stable of running backs. Steve Van Buren is one of the greatest Eagles of all-time, leading the team to NFL championships in 1948 and 1949. He also has 69 career touchdowns, the most by an Eagle. Brian Westbrook would be a great compliment here as he is one of the best pass-catching running backs of all time. The trademark elusiveness of LeSean McCoy led him to the most rushing yards in Eagles history. Then the great Wilbert Montgomery rounds out the group nicely, with his 6538 rushing yard and 45 rushing touchdowns.


**Full backs:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Keith Byars|1986-1992

Hey, remember full backs? Well, the Eagles had a pretty good one back in the day. Drafted 10th overall in the infamous 1986 NFL Draft out of Ohio State, Byars had a nice seven-year career with the Eagles, amassing over 6,000 yards from scrimmage and 30 total touchdowns.


**Offensive Tackles:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Jason Peters|2009-present
Bob Brown|1964-1968
Tra Thomas|1998-2008
Al Wistert|1943-1951

The Eagles’ have a long history of fantastic offensive tackles. We start with Pro Football Hall of Famer Bob Brown, who played five seasons for the team from 1964 to 1968. He is followed by Al Wistert, the key tackle of the repeat NFL Champions. Up next is future Hall of Famer Jason Peters. Peters has been one of the best left tackles in the league for a better part of a decade after being traded to the Eagles from the Buffalo Bills. Then lastly is Tra Thomas. Thomas was Donovan McNabb’s bodyguard during his over decade long stint with the team.


**Offensive Guards:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Evan Mathis|2011-2014
Jerry Sisemore|1973-1984
Todd Herremans|2005-2014

Our first offensive guard is Jerry Sisemore. Sisemore played both tackle and guard during his time with the team under Dick Vermeil, but because we are so stacked at tackle we will keep him inside. The other pair of guards are more recent players, Todd Herremmans and Evan Mathis. Both played for the Eagles for a decent amount of time and were keystones of good offensive lines.


**Centers:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Chuck Bednerick|1949-1962
Alex Wojciechowicz|1946-1950
Jason Kelce|2011-present

Since we are a little thin at guard we are going to go deep at center. Chuck Bednarik is here, and we will be talking about him later, but Chuck was just as great on the offensive side of the ball as he was on defense. Up next is Alex Wojciechowicz. Wojciechowicz played for the Eagles for only five years, but won two NFL Championships after leaving the Lions in 1946. Then lastly is Jason Kelce, the Mummer himself. Kelce’s trademark athleticism would be a huge asset on this line.


**Wide recievers:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Tommy McDonald|1957-1963
Harold Carmichael|1971-1983
Terrell Owens|2004-2005
Mike Quick|1982-1990
DeSean Jackson|2008-2013, present

First off, Harold Carmichael should no question be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He is not only one of the best Eagles’ best receivers of all time, but he was one of the best in his era. Writer Reuben Frank summed him up well with this stat, “during the 11-year period from 1973 through 1983, Carmichael had 43 more catches, 46 more yards and 10 more touchdowns than anybody in the NFL. During an eleven-year period, he was the best receiver in the game.” Opposite Carmichael, we have Tommy McDonald, a Pro Football Hall of Famer. T.O. needed to make the list despite his short, and tenous, time with the team. Mike Quick is often overlooked, but he was a great receiver for the Birds during his nine-year tenure with the team. He made five straight pro bowls, two All-Pro teams and on top of that is still an incredible commentator for the Eagles to this day. DeSean Jackson is one of the best deep threats in NFL history and will keep moving up in the record books now he is back with the team.


**Tight ends:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Pete Pihos|1947-1955
Pete Retzlaff|1956-1966
Brent Celek|2007-2017

The tight end group is pretty strong for the Birds. It is led by Pro Football Hall of Famer Pete Pihos. Phios led the NFL in receptions from 1953 to 1955 and made first-team All-Pro five times during his nine-year career. Pete Retzlaff is second on the Eagles’ all-time receiving list and a core member of the 1960 NFL Championship team. Then last Brent Celek is a career-long Eagle who scored 31 touchdowns, was an excellent blocker and a leader on the Super Bowl team.


**Defensive Ends:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Reggie White|1985-1992
Trent Cole|2005-2014
Clyde Simmons|1986-1993
Hugh Douglas|1998-2002

What can I really say about the Minister of Defense? He is one of the best players in football history and the Eagles all-time leader in sacks with 124. On the opposite side, we have Trent Cole who was a core piece of the Eagles for the better part of a decade, posting 85.5 sacks and forcing 19 fumbles. Behind Cole, is Clyde Simmons one of White’s teammates who posted 76.0 sacks in eight years with the Eagles. Then lastly, we have Hugh Douglas. Douglas only played with the Eagles for five years, but had 51.5 sacks during that time and a ridiculous 54 tackles for loss.


**Defensive Tackles:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Fletcher Cox|2012-present
Jerome Brown|1987-1991
Corey Simon|2000-2004
Andy Harmon|1991-1197

The group isn’t the strongest for the Eagles. Fletcher Cox is already the greatest defensive tackle in Eagles’ history. Cox is one of the most dominant pass rushers in the game from the interior and could end up in the hall one day. Next to him would be Jerome Brown, the heart of those dominant Eagles defenses helmed by Buddy Ryan. Corey Simon is up next. Simon was a big personality and key contributor for the Eagles’ early 2000s teams that went to four straight conference championships. Finishing the group is Andy Harmon. Harmon played for the Eagles for seven years in the 90s. During that time he racked up 39.5 sacks the second most in Eagles history for a defensive tackle, behind only Fletcher Cox.


**Linebackers:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Chuck Bednerick|1949-1962
Jeremiah Trotter|1998-2001, 2004-2006, 2009
Seth Joyner|1986-1993
Bill Bergey|1974-1980
Maxie Baughan|1960-1965

The linebacker core starts with the legendary Chuck Bednarik. Bednarik was one of the best two-way players in football history and played his entire 14-year career with the Birds. Bednarik has one of the most vicious hits in NFL history, made the Pro Bowl eight times, was a six-time All-Pro, and won two NFL Championships. I can’t say enough about “Concrete Charlie.” Up next is Seth Joyner, one of my favorite Eagles’ players of all time. Joyner was a special linebacker who excelled in all areas of the game. He could rush the passer, run stuff and play excellent pass coverage. He is underappreciated because of the defense he played on, but Joyner is borderline Hall of Fame worthy. Joyner is the only player in NFL history with 50 sacks and 20 interceptions. Our next linebacker is Jeremiah Trotter, or better known as the “Ax Man.” Trotter had multiple stints with the Eagles and always performed well for the Birds. A clubhouse leader, Trotter made four Pro Bowls with the Eagles and one All-Pro team. The final two slots on here go to two older players: Bill Bergy and Maxie Baughan. Bergy was a hard-nosed linebacker who was a two-time All-Pro for the Eagles, while Baughan was a member of the 1960 Championship team and made nine Pro Bowls during his career.


**Cornerbacks:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Eric Allen|1988-1994
Troy Vincent|1996-2003
Asante Samuel|2008-2011
Sheldon Brown|2002-2009
Herm Edwards|1977-1986
Bobby Taylor|1995-2003

The cornerbacks group is led by Eric Allen. Allen is another Eagles that should have a bust in Canton by now. Allen was dominant during his run with the Birds. During his seven years, he was a lockdown corner on the best defense in the league. He posted 34 interceptions, tied for the team record, and had five interceptions returned for touchdowns, a team record. Opposite Allen is Troy Vincent, who was acquired in 1996 in a trade with the Miami Dolphins. After coming to the Eagles, Vincent became one of the best corners in the league, going to five straight Pro Bowls. He is followed by two more recent players in Sheldon Brown and Asante Samuel. Brown is notorious for his devastating hit on Reggie Bush in the 2006 playoffs, but was a core corner for the Eagles for many years. Samuel didn’t play for the Eagles for long, but had a massive impact. He had 24 interceptions in just four years with the team, made three straight Pro Bowls (2008-2010), and helped lead the team to the playoffs in all three of those seasons. Herm Edwards is next on the depth chart. Edwards is best known for the Miracle at the Meadowlands, but he was a good corner during his nine years with the team, posting 33 interceptions during that time. The final spot at cornerback goes to Bobby Taylor. Taylor was underrated during his playing days, but he was a strong presence on the outside for the Eagles from 1995-2003. He made the Pro Bowl in 2002, and had 19 interceptions during his career in midnight green.


**Safety:**


Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:--                             
Brian Dawkins|1996-2008
Andre Waters|1984-1993
Wes Hopkins|1983-1993
Malcom Jenkins|2014-present

The safety group for the Eagles is filled with personality and a bunch of great players. It doesn’t get any better than Weapon X. Possibly the most beloved Philadelphia athlete of all-time was the core for Eagles’ defenses helmed by legendary defensive coordinator Jim Johnson. Dawkins was a playmaker, dazzling with interceptions and sacks, while dishing out crushing hits. Before Dawkins, came another hard-hitting safety in Andre Waters. Waters was the backbone of Buddy Ryan’s defense, amassing 910 tackles during his 10 years with the team, a team record. Waters’ partner at safety, Wes Hopkins, also makes the list. Hopkins had 30 interceptions during his decade long stint with the Eagles. Malcolm Jenkins is the greatest free agent signing in Eagles’ history. Since joining the team in 2014, Jenkins has become one of the team biggest leaders while also performing on the field. Known for his versatility, Jenkins plays all over the field from linebacker to cornerback to safety. He has produced 26 tackles for loss, 11 interceptions, eight forced fumbles and four defensive touchdowns while making three Pro Bowl teams. 


**Specialists:**


Position |Name | Years with Eagles                
:--|:-- |:--        
K|David Akers|1999-2010
P|Donnie Jones|2013-2017
LS|Jon Dorenbos|2006-2016
KR|Timmy Brown|1960-1967
PR|DeSean Jackson|2008-2013, present

David Akers is a no brainer since he is the Eagles’ all-time leading scorer (also a legend for trolling Dallas). I had to put Donnie “Bag O’ Bones” Jones on here not only because he is hilarious, but because he was a very good punter for his five years with the team, averaging 45.4 yards per punt during his tenure with a long of 72 yards. He will also be the team’s holder for field goal attempts. Long snapper is no doubt the “Magic Man” himself Jon Dorenbos. The former America’s Got Talent participant was not only a great story, but a damn good long snapper during his decade long stint with the Birds. He made the Pro Bowl twice and was named PFF’s best long snapper of 2014. Returning punts is DJax, and returning kickoffs is Timmy Brown. Brown holds the record for most kickoff return touchdown by an Eagles with five.

BTW, these are the teams I need writers for and their dates:

|Lions|4/11/19|Taken|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Colts|4/12/19||
|Packers|4/12/19|Taken|
|Raiders|4/15/19|**Taken**|
|Rams|4/16/19|**Taken**|
|Ravens|4/17/19|**Taken**|

The rules are here!

&gt;**This is going to be quite some work, especially with the older teams. If you don't think you can do the work, then you don't have to volunteer. As somebody who has taken criticism, people are always going to criticize your work. Not everybody will like what you post. If you can't handle it, again, you don't have to volunteer**\&gt;&gt;**The formatting does not matter of your post. However, I will use a format, so if you need any help, check out the other posts. My only rule is that they must be 53-man rosters, and the information in the post must relate to the franchise's all-time team or history. I would also prefer if you linked this hub somewhere in your post, but that is not required. I will PM you at some point a day before your posting date. I should also mention that if you don't like the date, we can reschedule to any date before the 25th. I'm pretty flexible when it comes to scheduling.**

If you want to write for a great team, it is first come, first serve!  If you can't write, I would be appreciated if you help me find one (not required). If you want to check out today's All-Time team, u/FancyKilerWales will post the All-Time Eagles. Anyways, thanks for viewing this and have a great day! :)

Hello and good morning! It's Robdog1330, and due to a situation that our original Browns writer had to deal with, I decided to write the All-Time Browns because I didn't feel like finding a replacement writer (I already posted on the Browns subreddit looking for a writer, but that person was the only one I could find that was interested at the time). Here is a new rule that I will put into effect. If a person that commented on the hub post for this series requesting for the job backs out, I will post something about needing a writer to that team's subreddit. However, if I do post to that team's subreddit, one person is interested, but that same person is also busy and can't do it, then I will just write it. By the way, I will not get mad at all if you are too busy to do the write-up after you ""committed."" Hopefully, this doesn't occur again, but I should have moved on to the team's history by now.

**History of the Cleveland Browns:**

In 1946, professional football was back in Cleveland with the AAFC's Cleveland Browns after the departure of the Rams from Cleveland. In their 4 years in the AAFC, the Browns won all of their championships, but in 1950, the Browns, along with the rest of the league, moved into the NFL. The Browns continued to dominate in the NFL, making the championship game each year from 1950-55, and winning three of those. They struggled in 1956 after Otto Graham retired, but were back on the promise land the next year with superstar running back Jim Brown. Brown led the Browns to the championship game three times with the Browns winning their most recent championship in 1964. After being mediocre for much of the 70s and early-to-mid 80s, the Browns made the AFC Championship Game three times from 1986-89. However, the Browns lost all three of those games, each to John Elway's Denver Broncos. The Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Ravens after the 1995 NFL season, but came back to the NFL in 1999. Unfortunately, the Browns have been a laughing stock for the last 20 years with only two winning seasons since returning to the NFL. Recently though, luck has turned around for the Browns as they have a potentially fun offense to watch with Baker Mayfield, Nick Chubb, Odell Beckham Jr., and Jarvis Landry coming into 2019. (Note: None of the four guys listed in that last sentence are on the All-Time Browns)

**Methodology:**

For the depth charts at each position using a formula that I will call ""[The All-Time Teams Formula](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqtpOiw6hu47-LlZeXlXp_-zDu99ZafGQDwKly8OWFc/edit?usp=sharing)"" The formula only accounts for a player's time with that team. For example, Paul Warfield's score for this All-Time Browns team does not includes his accolades for the Miami Dolphins. Secondly, stats didn't play too much of a factor in the way I ranked these players. I prefer Pro Football Reference's AV as a basis rather than stats because of era adjustments like QBs passing the ball a lot more in today's game. I would also like to note that I did not watch every player whether it be in-game or in highlights. This is especially true for those who played pre-1990. I did, however, do a lot of research on many of these guys.

Anyways, here is the All-Time Browns team underway!

**Coaches (Parenthesis represents years spent with the Browns as a coach of some sort)**

Head Coach: Paul Brown *(1946-62)*

Offensive Coordinator: Sam Rutigliano *(1978-84)*

Defensive Coordinator: Blanton Collier *(1962-70)*

Linebackers Coach: Marty Schottenheimer *(1980-88)*


**QBs**

|1|Otto Graham *(1946-55)*|253|10 Championship Games, 7x Champ, 5x MVP, 5x Pro Bowler, 9x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 5x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Brian Sipe *(1974-83)*|91.56|1x NFL MVP, 1x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Frank Ryan *(1962-68)*|74.83|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 1x Stat Leader|

A year ago to this day, the Browns were laughed at for having too many starting quarterbacks to name since 1999. However, the Browns actually have one of the better QB Depth Charts when looking at all 32 NFL All-Time teams. **Otto Graham**, in my opinion, is the seventh greatest quarterback in NFL history and is often overlooked when talking about the All-Time great quarterbacks. He also had the reputation of being a winner and made the championship game every year he was in the league. A tough decision I had to make was who the third-string quarterback was going to be for this team. I went with Frank Ryan over Bernie Kosar and Milt Plum because he led the Browns to their most recent NFL Championship in 1964 over the heavily-favored Colts and was an underrated quarterback during his time.



**RBs**

|1|Jim Brown *(1957-65)*|275.83|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x NFL MVP, 9x Pro Bowler, 1957 Rookie of the Year, 8x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Bert Bell Award, 13x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Leroy Kelly *(1964-73)*|150|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Bert Bell Award, 5x Stat Leader|
|3|Greg Pruitt *(1973-81)*|74.92|4x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|4|Dub Jones *(1948-55)*|73.5|8 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|
|FB1|Marion Motley *(1946-53)*|105|8 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|

The Browns have also had one of the best histories when it comes to running backs. **Jim Brown**, the starting RB, is the greatest running back of all-time (although Barry, Emmitt, and Sweetness all have arguments). He dominated the NFL during his time by leading the NFL in rushing yards 8 times and in rushing TDs 5 times. He would be even greater had he not retired after just nine seasons in the NFL. His successor was **Leroy Kelly**, who did not disappoint, as he led the NFL in rushing twice and in rushing TDs thrice. It was difficult deciding who the third running back was going to be. While Greg Pruitt and Dub Jones both made the 53-man roster, I gave the third-string running back role to Pruitt because he had 3 seasons with 1,000 rushing yards, even though, Jones was a winner under the Browns when they had Otto Graham.



**WRs**

|1|Dante Lavelli *(1946-56)*|135|10 Championship Games, 7x Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro, 2x Stat Leader|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Mac Speedie *(1946-52)*|116|7 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 6x 1st Team All-Pro, 6x Stat Leader|
|3|Paul Warfield *(1964-69, 1976-77)*|99.37|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|4|Gary Collins *(1962-71)*|96.09|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro, 1x Stat Leader|
|5|Ray Renfro *(1952-63)*|83.01|5 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RB5/WR6|Bobby Mitchell *(1958-61)*|67|1x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Browns also have a rich history when it comes to receivers. **Dante Lavelli** and **Mac Speedie** were Otto Graham's two primary receivers in the late 1940s and early 1950s and both had the argument for the first receiver spot. Warfield, Collins, and Renfro are pretty much locked in at the next three spots at the position, but I was unsure if I should include a sixth wide receiver. In the end, I decided to include Bobby Mitchell as the sixth wide receiver as I figured he could be a solid receiver and runner on this All-Time Browns team because he also played halfback with the team, even though his prime years were with the Redskins.



**TEs**

|1|Ozzie Newsome *(1978-90)*|118.22|3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 5x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Milt Morin *(1966-75)*|65.58|2x Pro Bowler|

Tight end is probably the weakest position on this team offensively. **Ozzie Newsome** was a great pass-catching tight end during the 1980s but was overshadowed by the even greater Kellen Winslow. Milt Morin was a solid tight end, although he was not the best and made the cut. However, I only went with two tight ends on the roster due to lack of depth there. Who would I put at the third tight end spot? Kellen Winslow II and Gary Barnidge had 1,000 receiving yards in a season this millennium, but do they really belong on the All-Time Browns?


**OL**

|LT1|Lou Groza *(1946-59, 1961-67)*|207.79|13 Championship Games, 8x Champ, 9x Pro Bowler, 6x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|LT2|Joe Thomas *(2007-17)*|167.66|10x Pro Bowler, 8x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|LT3|Dick Schafrath *(1959-71)*|124.7|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro|
|LG1|Jim Ray Smith *(1956-62)*|108.93|1 Championship Game, 5x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|LG2|Abe Gibron *(1950-56)*|90.5|6 Championship Games, 3x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|C1|Frank Gatski *(1946-56)*|119|10 Championship Games, 7x Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 4x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|C2|John Morrow *(1960-66)*|54.99|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RG1|Gene Hickerson *(1958-73)*|149.23|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 6x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RG2|Lin Houston *(1946-53)*|67|8 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RT1|Mike McCormack *(1954-62)*|131.83|3 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 7x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|RT2|Cody Risien *(1979-89)*|63.05|2x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Browns have easily one of the best All-Time offensive lines among the 32 All-Time teams. The Browns are so darn good at the left tackle spot that **Lou Groza** is starting over Joe Thomas and Dick Schafrath, who were both great left tackles during their time with the Browns. Although Groza is the best out of the bunch, their other starters are solid with **Jim Ray Smith, Frank Gatski, Gene Hickerson, and Mike McCormack** also blocking for Graham and Brown.



**DEs**

|1|Bill Willis *(1946-53)*|134|8 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 7x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Len Ford *(1950-57)*|120.5|7 Championship Games, 3x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Bill Glass *(1962-68)*|75.54|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|4|Paul Wiggin *(1957-67)*|58.13|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowl|

The Browns don't have as good of defensive ends as they do of defensive tackles, but they are still top-heavy at that position. **Bill Willis** could have been put in the roster as either a DE or a DT, but I put him at DE because he was great at stopping the run and rushing the quarterback. **Len Ford**, the defensive end starting opposite of Willis for this team, is also scary to face against for any quarterback and in fact, actually played with Willis during the early 1950s.



**DTs**

|1|Bob Gain *(1952-64)*|139.38|5 Championship Games, 3x NFL Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 6x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Michael Dean Perry *(1988-94)*|122.95|5x Pro Bowler, 5x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|3|Don Colo *(1953-58)*|90.5|4 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 4x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|4|Jerry Sherk *(1970-81)*|81.44|4x Pro Bowler, 1x Defensive POTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|
|5|Bob Golic *(1982-88)*|69.4|3x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|6|Walter Johnson *(1965-76)*|64.5|1 Championship Games, 3x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Browns are pretty stacked at defensive tackle and will stuff the run at any cost against all of the other All-Time teams. **Bob Gain** was one of the best run stuffing defensive tackle back in the 1950s and 1960s. **Michael Dean Perry** is also a great defensive tackle for this team, opposite of Gain and was one of the most powerful guys in the NFL during the 1990s as he completely stuffed the run. Don Colo and Jerry Sherk were also solid defensive tackles during their times, and I decided to include six of them because the Browns have a great history when it comes to that position.



**LBs**

|1|Walt Michaels *(1952-61)*|103.8|5 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 5x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 3x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2|Clay Matthews Jr. *(1978-93)*|87.05|4x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|
|3|Jim Houston *(1960-72)*|86.83|2 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 4x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro|
|4|Tony Adamle *(1947-51, 1954)*|72.5|8 Championship Games, 5x Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|
|5|Chip Banks *(1982-86)*|71.55|4x Pro Bowler, 1982 Defensive ROTY, 1x 1st Team All-Pro|
|6|Galen Fiss *(1956-66)*|65.63|3 Championship Games, 1x NFL Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Browns' All-Time linebackers are not that bad but are not spectacular compared to their other defensive position. **Walt Michaels**, **Clay Matthews Jr.**, and **Jim Houston** were solid linebackers, but they don't scare you quite as their defensive line does.


**CBs**

|1|Frank Minnifield *(1984-92)*|86.81|4x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 1x 2nd Team All-Pro|

The Browns at cornerback don't impress you at first if you look at their scores by my formula. However, **Frank Minnifield** and **Hanford Dixon** are more than just starting cornerbacks for this All-Time team. They were actually one of the best cornerback tandems of all-time and could clamp up all over receivers. Legend has it that Dixon once had 7 passes targeted his way in 1987 and finished that year with 3 interceptions. He was so good that quarterbacks feared throwing to the receiver that he was covering in a game.

|4|Ken Konz *(1953-59)*|58|4 Championship Games, 2x NFL Champ, 1x Pro Bowler, 2x 2nd Team All-Pro|

While **Warren Lahr** easily got the first safety roster spot on this All-Time team, the last four safeties were difficult to decide. **Don Paul** ended up getting the second safety spot in a close call between him and Thom Darden, who ended up getting the third spot at safety. Both were solid defensive backs that could catch some interceptions from quarterbacks. However, the toughest call I had to make was putting Ken Konz at the fourth safety spot over the late Eric Turner because he was the more consistent of the two. Turner's 1994 season was phenomenal, but he didn't really wow me other than that.

**Summary:**

Overall, this is a stacked team despite most of their ""great"" history being before the Super Bowl era. The Browns offense is going to be fun with Otto Graham throwing the ball to solid receivers like Lavelli, Speedie, and pass-catching tight end Ozzie Newsome. Not only is their passing game legit, but their running game is even better with the greatest running back of all-time in Jim Brown and solid second running back with Leroy Kelly gaining yards with their great all-time offensive line. Their defense isn't as stacked, but the defensive line is solid with Willis, Ford, Gain, and Michael Dean Perry stuffing the run and rushing the quarterback. Their secondary and linebackers aren't the best, they are underrated. Although Minnifield and Dixon, the two starting cornerbacks on this team, don't have as high of scores as other players do by my formula, but they were arguably the best cornerback tandem in the 1980s. The Browns have a really good return game with Josh Cribbs returning kicks for touchdowns.

52 of the 53 players made at least one Pro Bowl during their Cleveland Browns tenure with 48 of those making at least one All-Pro team. Lin Houston, the only non-Pro Bowler on this team, also made two All-Pro teams and is also the brother of linebacker and teammate (for the All-Time Browns), Jim Houston. The Browns have won quite a lot of MVPs with Graham winning five times, Brown winning three, and Sipe winning one in 1980. In addition, Jerry Sherk won Defensive Player of the Year in 1976.

Wow!  This is one of the better team we’ve looked at so far.  Defense is clearly this team’s greatest strength.  Every DB has at least 1 Pro Bowl, the linebacker corps is one of the strongest I’ve put together, and the D-Line is either sacking the QB or clogging the running lanes.  Really a suffocating defense.  

The offense, though not as good as other teams, is still really good.  Exceptional QB’s will be able to throw the ball to some of the greatest receivers of the 2000s in Witten and Johnson.  In the redzone you can toss the ball to the former basketball star Antonio Gates or Anquan Boldin.  The offensive line can open up huge holes for Johnson and McGahee to gallop through.  This is a very well rounded team. 

I did start Larry Johnson over McGahee because his peak was much higher, but man did he fall off of a cliff after his two All-Pro seasons.  I also started Romo over Palmer because Romo was a much more efficient QB.  He had a better completion percentage and a better TD:INT ratio.  Finally I started Antonio Gates over Jason Witten because he is a) a better redzone target and b) because I have experienced Gates torching my team twice a year for 15 years.  I see them as 1a and 1b at the TE spot

Fact from the draft, current Arizona Head Coach was drafted at QB by the Patriots this year

Troy Polamalu should get into the HOF this year.  Andre Johnson may have to wait a year or two just because of the Receiver logjam.  Lance Briggs should get in but I'm not sure if he will.  Once Terrell Suggs retires he should get in first ballot. The only guy I'm not sure about is Robert Mathis.  He has the stats but lacks the accolades HOF voters look for.

# Breakdown
Polarizing (v): Kyler Murray. People either love him or hate him. I don’t think I have ever seen so much attention given to every millimeter of someone’s height. This is the case I always make when I decide to measure my little buddy but then the argument starts on “where it starts” but that’s not here nor there. He officially measured in at 5’10” 1/8” but if you paid attention to this place before the combine, you would be convinced that he would need a step stool to climb each step in a staircase. He was also much heavier than people thought but there is skepticism that he went on a few dinner dates with Kelvin Benjamin to pack on some pounds before the combine.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Height is not the only knock on this guy. He definitely didn’t do himself any favors when he was flipping back and forth with his MLB offer and his NFL status. When he finally decided on football, he decided not to participate at the combine despite attending for his measurable. Typically, this is not a red flag because many players choose not to participate (Sam Darnold last year) but I know it rubbed people the wrong way.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
What some people may not know about Murray is he has a history of dominance as a football player. In high school, not only did he win 3 straight state championships in Texas where football is taken more seriously than Tim Tebow’s baseball career, but he went undefeated; 42-0 missing just one game. He was a 5-star recruit coming out of high school and the best dual-threat QB in the nation. So, he’s not just some stellar player that strictly uses his athleticism to win; the guy knows how to throw the ball.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
It’s harder to see here than when the spa worker had to locate Robert Kraft’s bologna pony from all the smokescreens that Arizona has been tossing, but is he worth their first overall pick?
 
# Strengths

I’m going to be completely honest here. Before I started any film study on Kyler Murray, I was not the biggest fan/sold on him. Then I started to feel a bit guilty because I never gave him a chance, kind of like how Frank Gore noped right out of Philly. After about 15 hours of film study, I feel like my narrative has changed. The kid is a human highlight reel and makes jaw-dropping plays every single game. Just to keep this breakdown within Reddit’s character limit, I will focus on his last two games. I want to do this because it was his most important games as a college player (Big 12 Championship &amp; College Playoffs).
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
The thing that separates Kyler Murray and the rest of the other quarterbacks in this draft class is easily his athleticism. Not only does he look like the fastest player on the field at times, but his elusiveness in the pocket and threat of the run is something you can’t see in the stat line.
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Athleticism

Everyone knows by now that Murray is fast, but how fast is he? This [play](https://imgur.com/9KOuodz) shows why Kyler is a special player. Not only is he able to elude a pocket that’s breaking down, but he also beats the spy for a big first down. Imagine your only job is to ignore everything and contain a QB and still failing; a bigger disappointment than the AAF league.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Okay, maybe you’re not impressed that he was able to beat a spy. How about the time he was able to get the [edge](https://imgur.com/gallery/paGxMtr) against a corner and then juked out another player? He has a [jab](https://imgur.com/qQlBIx0) step that some running backs would dream to have. Looking at you China food Lacy/2 yards per carry Richardson.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Despite what you may think, Kyler is not always a run first QB. He constantly keeps his eyes down the field when a play is breaking down. [This](https://imgur.com/YdGu7g7) may be one of my favorite throws by Murray. The play is breaking down, he steps up in the pocket and keeps his eyes down the field and delivers a perfect pass to his receiver who is torching two defenders. The more I watch the play, the more impressed I get. There aren’t many people on this planet that can deliver that ball the way he did. Seriously though, this kid is running up the pocket, throwing it without setting his feet, and launching it 50 yards in the air perfectly in stride to his receiver. If that doesn’t get you as excited as John Elway seeing a 6’6” quarterback prospect, I don’t know what to tell you.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Due to Murray’s ability to use his legs, the playbook opens up to get more [creative](https://imgur.com/gallery/xB1RT2l) and I’m not talking about just Wildcat stuff. There are so many different possibilities that an offensive coach can utilize so I don’t blame Kliff’s fascination. With college concepts working more and more every year in the NFL, it’s no coincidence that Arizona hired Kliff. I bet their dozen fans are pumped.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
One thing that surprised me about Murray was his pocket awareness. As a dual-threat QB, it’s easy to hone in on one of your skill assets, but when everything comes together, [beautiful](https://imgur.com/S2yTKHo) things begin to happen. He just makes it look effortless when [eluding](https://imgur.com/gallery/mzoBiJ3) defenders in the pocket. Just the way he navigates through traffic while looking for his open receivers is not something you see too often from younger guys.
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Arm Talent
 
Enough about Murray’s feet. *Rex Ryan has left the chat.* What begins to separate Kyler from other mobile quarterbacks in the past is his excellent passing ability. He is a true dual-threat QB because along with his legs, he has great arm [strength](https://imgur.com/gallery/bIG1zVr) and accuracy &amp; [touch](https://imgur.com/r6K53wO). I mean he just hurls this thing from the 35 to the other 10 in the air with ease. After watching all of his games and in-depth film, I can confidently say that he can make all the throws. One of the hardest passes is to the sideline and Murray can put it on a [line](https://imgur.com/WZ8UWxb) right where he needs to be. I can’t vouch how great he looks in shorts, but I know his arm isn’t on Josh Allen’s level but it is plenty good enough to make NFL GM’s notice.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Accuracy is what got Baker a lot of praise when he was coming out of college and I can say that Murray isn’t too [bad](https://imgur.com/gallery/lNFpGSB) either. What stands out is Murray’s ability to throw his receiver’s open. At first, this [play](https://imgur.com/sHyCp0o) looks like an inaccurate pass, but if you look at it from another [angle](https://imgur.com/kmdaR33) you can see that he is leading his receiver to the open area of the field. If you pair him up with some smart receivers that have the ability to run option routes as many Y receivers do on many teams, Murray will thrive.
 
&amp;nbsp;

Just like a majority of college quarterbacks coming out, Murray has a small issue with staring at his number one read. In Lincoln Riley’s offense, they scheme a lot of players wide open so it is not usually a big issue but I was surprised to see that Murray was pretty adept at going through [reads](https://imgur.com/gallery/xRhC9Ik). He will need to continue to develop on this but he is further ahead than many prospects coming out from an “easy” offense.

&amp;nbsp;

##Intangibles
 
I said last year that one of Baker’s stronger attribute was his ability to improve when a play is breaking down or thrive under chaotic situations and once again, his buddy does [too](https://imgur.com/gallery/sVazWBK). It almost looks like an illusion to see him flick his wrist and spin the ball perfectly to where it needs to be. Peterman is on suicide watch seeing a QB effortlessly do this.
 
&amp;nbsp;

You typically don’t see mobile quarterbacks be able to drop back and get into a rhythm in the pocket but don’t worry, Kyler’s got you [bby](https://imgur.com/KWMvLWj). He is able to time his drop back and throw an easy rhythm pass to his receiver. Although Oklahoma likes to run a lot of different schemes, Murray is still able to drop back and throw [rhythm](https://imgur.com/xexDbHV) passes as well.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
The beauty of Murray’s game isn’t that he’s just an off-script player. He also gets into his 3-step drops, scans his options, and delivers a ball in rhythm. It’s rare to find players that thrive both as a rhythm passer and off script through chaos. He has great touch on his balls^( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) , good arm strength, and understands how to read some coverages.
 
# Weaknesses

I know I just gushed about Kyler the way Bill Bellichick does about left-footed punters but he’s not perfect. What weaknesses does he have besides the fact that Tinder girls won’t swipe right after they see his height? 
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Overreliance
 
He is normally one of the most athletic players on the field so it’s no surprise that he tries to make a home run play on every down but sometimes, it [doesn’t](https://imgur.com/823W8oY) work out. It reminds me of the same mentality A.D. had when he tried to break every single run for a touchdown but sometimes, it ended up hurting him more than helping. He will be on a more level playing field in the NFL so he won’t have as big as an advantage as he has been used to; ask Dorial Green-Beckham how that worked out.
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Size
 
Although his height is a concern, his weight may arguably present an even bigger issue. It’s hard to imagine someone at his size being durable enough to be able to withstand all the beatings the NFL has to throw at him. To be fair, he had some fair share of [big](https://imgur.com/gallery/9sqahkV)[hits] (https://imgur.com/nhFd3uw). Somewhere out there, Gregg William’s nipples just got erect at the thought of injuring someone as small as Kyler.
 

&amp;nbsp;
 
Like I mentioned earlier, I am more concerned about his weight than his height. Although he takes the elevator to hit a baseball on a tee, he did not get many balls [batted](https://imgur.com/cgog0U9). I think I only count about 5 or 6 times throughout all my hours of film where it occurred. You can see that he is used to throwing at his size by the [trajectory](https://imgur.com/iOtwN9L) of some of his passes. He floats it enough so it can’t get batted despite looking up to Gary Coleman.
 
&amp;nbsp;

##Talented Team
 
Another knock on him is how he has been surrounded by talent. While this may not be on the top of the list of concerns with him since Baker is producing at the NFL when he had similar red flags, it still merits a mention. There are numerous times where Murray had [endless](https://imgur.com/1qxjYlS) time in the pocket. Even during a [blitz](https://imgur.com/lsGXiWA) his offensive line gave him enough time for Josh Rosen to get sacked 4 times. He also had Marquise “Hollywood” Brown who may go in the first round of the Draft. It can’t be that hard to throw to someone who roasts defenders to the point that Andy Reid can’t decipher if he should feast or confuse them for Bob Sutton’s corners.

&amp;nbsp;

##Shotgun

One last thing I wanted to mention is that he primarily took almost all of his snaps from the shotgun. This is not unusual in college, especially at Oklahoma. I didn’t even want to bring this point up because he looked very fluid at his Pro Day when he was under center and Baker Mayfield proved that you can be successful going from Riley’s offense to under center more often but I just thought that it is on some people’s radar.

&amp;nbsp;
  
# Player Comparison
A lot of people have compared Murray to Wilson, and I feel like that’s a very fair comparison. They are both shorter QBs who are exciting that can win games both inside the pocket and their feet. I think Murray is more explosive than Russ but Russ is a better playmaker down the stretch. Murray also has that rare athleticism that Mike Vick had entering the league except Murray knows how to slide thanks to baseball.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
Now I know that it’s lazy to compare Murray to Wilson and Vick but I’m trying to draw parallels with their skillset. The way the Russ can extend plays with his legs while keeping his eyes down the field is something Murray does very well. The way Vick can whip the ball down the field with a small flick of the wrist and his explosiveness is also something Kyler can bring to the table. I’m not saying that Murray is as good as Wilson or as good of an athlete as Vick was, but when I was watching all the film, I kept thinking how his skillset reminded me of them. I mean look how crazy [this](https://imgur.com/wvFveNk) is; it reminds me of that iconic Randall Cunningham play.
 
&amp;nbsp;
 
# Recap
Murray is the most polarizing player in this draft for a reason. With all of the skillsets he presents along with his *shortcomings*, it’s easy to see why everyone is all over the place with him. He is a true dual-threat quarterback that would be a dream to work with for any offensive minded coach. Now is he a better prospect than Dwayne Haskins? Well, they fill two completely different roles so depending on who you need commanding your offense, that will ultimately decide who will fit into the team. It is bizarre to see how Kyler Murray's [projections](https://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/212/manning.png) look compared to Dan Marino's coming out of college.

[Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b2pd6z/new_series_32_nfl_alltime_teams_in_32_days_part_0/)

**History**

Miami was awarded the 9th AFL expansion in 1966, joining the AFL East which included the Boston Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Houston Oilers and New York Jets. Miami would remain with the Patriots, Bills and Jets following the 1970 AFL-NFL merger with the newly created AFC East, which would also see the addition of the Baltimore Colts from the NFL. The franchise’s AFL years were abysmal and saw very little success led by former Detroit Lions head coach George Wilson, who was dismissed after the 1969 season.

Following the hiring of Don Shula in 1970, the Dolphins went on to become one of the winningest franchises in the NFL, reaching three straight Super Bowls and winning the last two, and again appearing in two more Super Bowl in the 1980s. The ‘70s era was hallmarked by dominant running games, excellent offensive lines and tough defensive play in the form of the No-Name Defense, while the ‘80s team, also having excellent offensive lines and defensive play (the Killer B’s this time), had premier passing from Dan Marino. 

The Dolphins remained competitive through the 1990s before their decline following Marino’s retirement in 1999. Despite this, the Dolphins continued to field a solid defense through most of the 2000s, and while many of their seasons since the early 2000s have been plagued by the mediocrity bug, the Dolphins remain in the top 5 of all-time winning percentages for NFL teams and are the only NFL team to finish with a perfect season.

**Head Coach - Don Shula (1970-1995)** - The all-time winningest NFL head coach, Shula was a mastermind for both the Baltimore Colts in the ‘60s and the Miami Dolphins in the ‘70s and ‘80s, establishing a winning culture and an emphasis on getting the most out of every player. Shula was a hard-nosed disciplinarian that ran a tight ship but was beloved by his players and counterparts. Shula only had two losing seasons his entire time in Miami and during his reign the Dolphins had one of the highest winning percentages in the NFL. 

**QB - Dan Marino (1983-1999)** – Going into the 1983 NFL Draft, the University of Pittsburgh star watched his stock drop due to off-the-field concerns and an underwhelming senior year; however, the Dolphins saw something special in him. By Marino’s second season in 1984, he led the Dolphins to a 14-2 record and passed for over 5,000 yards and 48 touchdowns, both of which were NFL records. The ’84 Dolphins would also reach the Super Bowl, succumbing to the 15-1 49ers in a 38-16 loss. Marino would continue to exhibit dominance in the air with two more 4,000+ yard seasons, including one with over 4700 yards in 1986. Even though Marino suffered a devastating Achilles injury during the ’93 season, he bounced back in 1994 earning NFL Comeback Player of the Year honors along with his last 4,000+ yard season. The ’94 season also saw the infamous fake spike execution, known as “The Clock Play” against the New York Jets at the Meadowlands, resulting in a 28-24 victory. While the last few years of Marino’s career were in decline, he held a number of NFL passing records upon his retirement (passing yards (in a season and career), touchdowns (in a season and career), among many other records). He also has the distinction of having won the NFL MVP (1984), Comeback Player of the Year (1994) and Man of the Year (1998).

**QB - Bob Griese (1967-1980)** – The multi-sport talent coming out of Purdue had an immediate impact on the Dolphins after being drafted in 1967. Griese reached the AFL All-Star Game during his first two seasons and would become a cornerstone of the franchise following the Shula hire in 1971. Griese won the NFL MVP in 1971 and led the Dolphins to their first Super Bowl appearance. In 1972, Griese suffered a gruesome leg injury and out for most of the season. Griese, despite his broken leg and ankle, was able to come in for former Baltimore Colt Earl Morrall who was banged up at the half of the AFC Championship Game in Pittsburgh. Griese finished out the game and led the Dolphins to their second straight Super Bowl appearance. In 1973, Griese bounced back and started 13 games for the Dolphins, leading Miami to a 12-2 record and its second straight Super Bowl win. Griese had a few more successful runs throughout the ‘70s before retiring following the 1980 season.

**RB - Jim Kiick (1968-1974)** - Known as a versatile running back with power, excellent blocking and pass-catching abilities, Kiick provided was a complementary component to the Dolphins’s lethal backfield during Miami’s Super Bowl seasons in the early ‘70s. Kiick enjoyed sharing the backfield with Mercury Morris and was instrumental in key playoff games against the Kansas City Chiefs in 1971 and Cleveland Browns in 1972. During the 1970 season, Kiick led the AFC with 1,155 total yards from scrimmage. His toughness and determination were never questioned as he often played through injuries. Likewise, he was roommates with Larry Csonka and the duo shared the honor of being dubbed as “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” due to their off-the-field antics.

**RB - Mercury Morris (1969-1975)** – Morris was a pivotal component of the ’72 and ’73 Dolphins backfield (along with Kiick and Larry Csonka), rushing for 1900 yards over both seasons and scoring 22 touchdowns. The three-time Pro Bowl running back also served as the Dolphins primary kick and punt returner during the 1971 season while backing up Jim Kiick. Morris had incredible speed and was hard to tackle. He collected 72 and 76 yards in the 1972 AFC Divisional and AFC Championship Games, and although his career ended prematurely due to a gruesome neck injury, he finished with an average of 5.1 yards a carry, which was third all-time among NFL players at that time.

**RB/RS - Tony Nathan (1979-1987)** - The Alabama great was a key player during the Dolphins’s Super Bowl runs in the 1980s in addition to being a successful return specialist during his rookie campaign. Nathan started in both Super Bowls XVII and XIX and amassed 3,543 yards rushing, 383 receptions for 3,592 yards, and 32 touchdowns over 9 seasons with the Dolphins. Nathan also had 169 total yards and scored two touchdowns in the famous 1981 “Epic in Miami” playoff game against the San Diego Chargers. Nathan would go on to serve as Shula’s running backs coach following his retirement.

**RB - Ricky Williams (2002-2007, 2007-2010)** - The Heisman Trophy winner known for the infamous 1999 NFL Draft trade involving the New Orleans Saints and Washington Redskins, was traded to the Dolphins following the 2001 season. Williams had an immediate impact and quickly became a fan favorite, racking up over 1800 yards rushing and 18 touchdowns. 2003 was also a successful rushing year for Williams, who accumulated 1300 yards rushing and 9 touchdowns. Following the 2003 season Williams decided to retire early following a third failed drug test. The Dolphins collapsed to a 4-12 record; however, in 2005 Williams returned and played one more season before being suspended for all of the 2006 season for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. Williams returned for one more stint in Miami (2007-2011), becoming a pivotal piece to the 2008 Wildcat Formation with Ronnie Brown. 

**RB - Ronnie Brown (2005-2010)** - Coming out of Auburn, Brown was highly lauded and taken by the Dolphins with the second overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft. Brown became the Dolphins’s primary back during Ricky Williams’s four-game suspension  Brown shared the load with Williams in both his rookie year and again in 2008, while in 2006 with Williams suspended for the entire season Brown emerged as Miami’s primary back. Despite some nagging injuries and issues with the offensive line and overall offensive output, Brown made the Pro Bowl as a reserve back in 2009. Brown is probably best known for being the complementary back to Williams in the 2008 Wildcard Formation, which led Miami to their last AFC East division title to date. 

**FB - Larry Csonka (1968-1974, 1979)** - Zonk remains one of the all-time Miami greats whose toughness combined with his personality on and off the field made him one of the most exciting running backs of the 1970s. Standing at 6’3” 235 pounds, Csonka was an enormous power back described as a “bulldozer” and “battering ram”, giving defenders a lot of grief as an unstoppable force in the backfield. In 1972, Csonka rushed for over 1,000 yards, and combined with running back Mercury Morris, the Dolphins were the first team to feature two backs rushing for 1,000 yards each in a single season. Csonka was also known for his wild personality and antics off the field, coined as part of the “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” celebrity persona with fellow running back and roommate Jim Kiick. Csonka was well-respected by his teammates and earned “Super Athlete of the Year” honors by Pro Football Writers of America in 1973 and also captured the Super Bowl VIII MVP the same season.

**WR - Mark Clayton (1983-1992)** - One of the two Marks Brothers, Clayton had a prolific second season catching over 1300 yards and 18 touchdowns, reaching the Pro Bowl and proving to be one of Marino’s favorite targets during his record-setting second year in 1984. Clayton returned to the Pro Bowl in 1985, 1986, 1988 and lastly in 1991. Clayton is tied for 39th in all-time receiving yards and 13th all-time in receiving touchdowns. He also holds several Dolphins records and finished his career with 8900 yards receiving and 84 touchdowns. Clayton famously appeared in 2003 at Marino’s Hall of Fame Induction and caught one last pass from Dan the Man. 

**WR - Mark Duper (1982-1992)** - The other Marks Brother, Super Duper was another Marino favorite down the field and was a huge contributor to Miami’s passing attack in the ‘80s. Duper made the Pro Bowl in 1983, 1984 and 1986; specifically, Duper’s best seasons were in 1984 and 1986 when he had 71 catches, 1306 yards and 8 touchdowns and 67 catches, 1313 yards and 11 touchdowns, respectively. Duper along with Clayton was let go after the ’92 season. Both were inducted into the Miami Dolphins Ring of Honor in 2003. 

**WR - Nat Moore (1974-1986)** - Florida native Nat Moore was drafted following Miami’s Super Bowl run in 1974 and quickly emerged as a strong contributor to the Dolphins offense. His best season came in 1977 when he caught 52 passes and scored 12 touchdowns, earning a Pro Bowl trip. He earned fame in 1984 at the Meadowlands against the Jets with his famous “helicopter catch”, helping the Dolphins to come from behind and defeat the Jets. Moore benefited from playing with both Griese and Marino, and prior to his retirement he broke several Dolphins receiving records. He continues to be involved with the Dolphins serving as a VP in the organization overseeing the Miami Dolphins Alumni Association.

**WR - Paul Warfield (1970-1974)** - Warfield had spent his first 6 seasons with the Browns prior to being traded to the Dolphins in exchange for the third pick in the 1970 NFL Draft. Warfield had an immediate impact, playing a crucial role in the early ‘70s Dolphins Super Bowl runs and catching 11 touchdowns twice during that span (1971 and 1973). Warfield was voted to the Pro Bowl during his entire tenure with the Dolphins and was super athletic, fast and difficult to cover. Warfield only spent 5 seasons with the Dolphins, but his impact on the Dolphins remains strong to this day.

**WR - Jarvis Landry (2014-2017)** - The Juice is probably one of the more popular Dolphins players in recent memory. Taken in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft out of LSU, Landry quickly emerged as a favorite target of Ryan Tannehill’s. His agility and yards after catch were crucial in moving the chains and he even broke the Dolphins rookie record for receptions with 84. Landry was also a solid contributor on special teams, returning his first touchdown in a 2015 Week 1 victory over the Redskins. In 2016, Landry amassed over 1,000 yards receiving and had 612 yards after catch, second in the NFL. A fan favorite, following the 2017 season Landry was traded to the Cleveland Browns much to the chagrin of many fans. His 400 receptions in Miami are the most by any player in his first four years in NFL history.

**WR - OJ McDuffie (1993-2000)** - McDuffie was drafted in the 1st round of the 1993 NFL Draft, which ushered in a new era of wide receivers following the departures of the Marks Brothers. McDuffie quickly became a favorite target of Marino’s and ranks fourth all-time in receptions (415) and led the NFL with 90 receptions in 1998, which was his best season statistically (1,000+ yards receiving). That same season McDuffie caught Marino’s 399th, 400th and 401st touchdown passes in a 31-10 victory over the New Orleans Saints.

**TE - Jim Mandich (1970-1977)** - The Dolphins have never been known for being strong at the TE position; however, Mad Dog Mandich was a key offensive contributor and colorful personality during his time with the Dolphins as a player as well as after his career as a radio personality for the Dolphins. Mandich was beloved by fans and his best years were during the 1973 and 1974 seasons. 

**TE - Bruce Hardy (1978-1989)** - Hardy was a 6’6” monster who quickly became a physical force on offensive after becoming the starting TE during the 1979 season. Hardy’s best statistical campaigns occurred from 1984 to 1986, during which he caught over 1,000 yards and 14 touchdowns. Two of his best career performances happened against the Jets in the ’84 and ’85 seasons.

**LT - Richmond Webb (1990-2000)** - Webb may be considered Miami’s greatest left tackle ever. A model of consistency, Webb started 118 straight games protecting Marino’s blind side and allowing his quick release to prosper against some of the fiercest pass rushers in the NFL. Webb was a 7-time Pro Bowler, two-time First Team All-Pro and two-time Second Team All-Pro. Webb was very talented and has unfortunately been overlooked for Pro Football Hall of Fame consideration due to the fact that he played during an era that was rich with talented left tackles. 

**LT - Wayne Moore (1970-1978)** - Moore was an anchor that helped to fuel the Dolphins’s dangerous running attack in the early ‘70s. During his time with the Dolphins, the pass protection and running game flourished, especially playing an important role against the Purple People Eaters in Super Bowl VIII. Despite knee injuries, Moore, overall, was a stable force on the offensive line and his emergence during the ’72 season could not have happened at a better time. Moore enjoyed a Pro Bowl year in 1973 and continued to be the starting left tackle through the 1978 season when he retired from the NFL. 

**LG - Bob Kuechenberg (1970-1984)** - Arguably one of Miami’s greatest interior linemen, Kuechenberg was a man of steel, breaking his arm near the end of the 1973 season and dominating Minnesota Vikings great Alan Page in Super Bowl VIII (Kuechenberg had a metal rod placed in his arm by doctors as he had refused to miss any games). Kuechenberg was a 6-time Pro Bowler, a two-time First Team All-Pro and a Second Team All-Pro during his long and successful career as a Dolphin. 

**LG - Keith Sims (1990-1997)** - Sims entered the NFL at the same time as Webb, and together they anchored a strong left side that kept Marino on his feet. Like Webb, Sims was consistent, reliable and made three straight Pro Bowl appearances (1993, 1994, 1995) and a Second Team All-Pro (1994). 

**C - Jim Langer (1970-1979)** - Considered one of the greatest NFL centers of ever, Langer guided the successful Dolphins offensive line during the team’s Super Bowl run and provided leadership and exemplary run blocking and pass protection. Longer was the leader on the line, and his guidance helped to establish grueling victories at the line of scrimmage during Miami’s best years. Longer played every snap in 1972 and was voted to six straight Pro Bowls. He was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility in 1987.

**C - Dwight Stephenson (1980-1987)** - Like Longer, Stephenson is considered one of the greatest NFL centers ever. The Dolphins with Stephen at center (and as offensive captain) led the league with the fewest sacks allowed for six straight seasons (an NFL record). Stephenson made five straight Pro Bowls, was voted First Team All-Pro five consecutive times and won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1985. Sadly, a devastating knee injury involving New York Sack Exchange greats Joe Klecko and Marty Lyons forced Stephenson to retire early in 1987. He was voted into the Pro Football of Fame in 1998.

**RG - Larry Little (1969-1980)** - Following an unsuccessful stint with the Chargers, Little was traded to the Dolphins in 1969 where he became an immediate success. Little exhibited excellent pass blocking and run blocking, and demonstrated superb leadership to younger players. Shula praised his leadership and he was named First Team All-Pro from 1971 through 1975, and again in 1977. He made Second Team All-Pro in 1978, and five Pro Bowls (1970, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975). Little was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003.

**RG - Ed Newman (1973-1984)** - Newman spent the first part of his career starting games here and there before emerging as a starting guard during the 1979 season. By 1981, Newman made his first of four straight Pro Bowl appearances. He was also a First Team All-Pro during his final season in 1984, and played in three Super Bowls. Newman was a key contributor to an incredibly successful 1980s Dolphins offensive line. 

**RT - Norm Evans (1966-1975)** - Evans was drafted by the expansion Dolphins in 1966, where he quickly moved into the right tackle position. From 1971 to 1974, Evans started every game at right tackled and earned two Pro Bowl trips in 1971 and 1974. During Evans’s best years at right tackle Miami flourished as a power running team and Bob Griese had more than enough time in the pocket to work his magic. 

**T - Jon Giesler (1979-1988)** - While Giesler played left tackle for most of his career, due to the right tackle position’s top players having shorter careers, Giesler could not be left out. He once went 38 straight games without giving up a sack and had successfully transitioned as a special teams player and backup to a starting left tackle. As mentioned above under Stephenson, the ‘80s Dolphins gave up the fewest sacks in the league for six straight seasons, and Giesler played a significant role in a achieving that milestone while protecting Marino and other Dolphins QBs during that time.

Ian Thomas- got some good reps when Olsen went down. Was deemed a raw prospect and it showed a couple times his rookie year. Was involved in a few plays with key blocks for CMC. Showed good flashes in the passing game and we are hopeful he’s Olsen’s heir. 

Bradberry- Most of us think he’s a really solid #1 CB. We run a lot of plays where he lines up way too deep. When we put him in press coverage against Evans he really shined. Not a guy that gets a lot of picks but good in coverage.

Hello everyone,

As of today, there are 20 days left until the first round of the NFL Draft begins, and this is a continuation of my countdown to the draft, where I will be outlining the best players taken at each draft slot from 32 to 1. Today is the 20th overall pick, which is currently held by the Steelers this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 20th overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Jack Youngblood|DE|1971|LAR|139|HOF
Forrest Gregg|T|1956|GB|113|HOF, AV not recorded before 1960

542,"My list of Pro Comparisons for the 2019 draft’s top Wide Receivers.
Here is my list of Pro Comps for the top WR prospects in this upcoming draft.

**DK Metcalf: Josh Gordon**

DK, much like Gordon, often seemed to ""out-athlete"" the DBs trying to cover him, either jogging past them outright or out-jumping them in 1-on-1 situations. Honestly, some of his plays were Moss-esque. However, injuries seemed to be an issue for him, and he needs to work on reducing his drop rate. And while his 3-cone of 7.33 may be concerning, keep in mind Randy Moss [reportedly ran a 7.19](http://nflcombineresults.com/playerpage.php?f=Randy&amp;l=Moss&amp;i=27002)

**Marquise Brown: T.Y. Hilton**

Brown, just like Hilton, is a home run threat every time he touches the ball. He gains great separation downfield, but is still very capable at gaining YAC from screens and shallower routes. However, he's going to have to gain some weight if he wants to be able to compete with NFL corners at the line of scrimmage.

**A.J. Brown: Thicc JuJu Smith-Schuster**

Metcalf for the ceiling, Brown for the floor. A.J. Brown does everything well. He can line up inside or outside, he's solid in 1-on-1 situations, has great hands and is excellent after the catch. People questioning his speed are probably the same people that questioned JuJu's speed - and JuJu has 3 plays of 90+ yards in two seasons.

**N'Keal Harry: Dez Bryant**

Most people remember Dez Bryant as a physical, strong receiver who could bully DB's. However, they seem to forget that he was also pretty effective running after the catch with great vision and lateral agility. Harry is very similar. A big frame with strong hands and a 38"" vertical, and also able to make people miss in the open field.

**Terry McLaurin: Stefon Diggs**

McLaurin always seems to be open. Efficient route running will do that. While he may not have the top-end athleticism to dominate on the outside, his knack for finding holes in the defense combined with his 4.35 speed will leave defenses guessing.

**Kelvin Harmon: Michael Crabtree**

Might be the pound-for-pound strongest receiver in the class. Absolutely excellent body control and strong hands to secure the catch. Great ball tracking, spatial awareness and hand-eye-coordination. Like Crabtree, his issues primarily stem from difficulty separating from cornerbacks. He also isn't much of an explosive athlete. However, he makes up for those things with his aggressiveness and technical ability when the ball is in the air. His blocking is top-notch as well.

**Hakeem Butler: A.J. Green**

Long, lanky frame? Check. Downfield speed? Check. Long, strong arms able to pluck the ball out of the air vs a DB? Check. Tackle-breaking ability after the catch? Check. If he works on drop issues and plays with a little bit more urgency, Butler has the potential to be a very capable No. 1 who is able to make highlight-reel plays downfield.

**Parris Campbell: Between Curtis Samuel and Percy Harvin**

It's hard to think of a pro comparison for Campbell. While he's a burner, there aren't many players who fit both his style of play and his 6'0, 205 lb frame. However, watching him play, Percy Harvin's name comes to mind. The athletic ability is all there in front of Campbell. If he can work on polishing the technical parts of the position, he'll be able to reach Harvin's potential as a receiver. But until then, he won't be more than a Curtis Samuel.

**J.J. Arciega-Whiteside: Allen Robinson**

Whiteside doesn't have deep speed or any special separation abilities. What he does have, however, is the ability to put himself in the best position to make the catch. I hate to say it, but JJAW played basketball in high school and nearly ended up playing b-ball in college, and you can see it in the way he plays. His ability to box out the defender and take them out of the play is outstanding, and his strong hands and thick frame help him immensely. It'll be interesting how he fares against stronger NFL competition.

[Hub Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b2pd6z/new_series_32_nfl_alltime_teams_in_32_days_part_0/)

Hello and welcome! Below is a compiled list of the all-time roster for the Dallas Cowboys. While putting this list together, I tried to keep a balance between statistical success, legendary prowess, and fan favorites. This was a difficult undertaking, and mistakes were absolutely made. My fellow Cowboys fans will certainly put me on blast for some of my decisions.

The Dallas Cowboys, founded in 1960, are one of the most successful teams in the history of the National Football League. With 8 Super Bowl appearances, the highest winning percentage ever, and 24 Hall of Famers, some tough choices needed to be made in determining the greatest Cowboys. Instead of going through every single player, I’ll be giving a brief overview for each position. Some will be more in-depth than others. Please enjoy!

*Italic indicates Pro Football Hall of Famer*

**Head Coach:** *Tom Landry*, 1960-1988. Landry was one of the pioneers of modern football, a genius of the game on par with Vince Lombardi. Without him, the Cowboys never come close to ever being referred to as America’s Team.

**Quarterback:** Of course, what would the Cowboys be without a star QB? This is the first of many positions where the Cowboys have an embarrassment of riches. This depth chart could be random and whoever was starting would be able to win games. There’s not much debate among Cowboys fans that Staubach is the best Cowboys QB ever. With his All-American attitude and “Captain Comeback” reputation, there’s no one better at the helm. In what’s potentially a controversy, I went with Romo over Aikman for the backup job. Aikman wasn’t as much of a statue in the pocket as some believe, but Romo’s ability to move around, create space, and buy time to get the throw off is a fantastic asset.

|Position/depth|Name|Years with Cowboys|
:--|:--|:--|
|QB1|*Roger Staubach*|1969-1979|
|QB2|Tony Romo|2003-2016|
|QB3|*Troy Aikman*|1989-2000|

**Running Back:** Another embarrassment of riches. Two Hall of Famers, a phenomenal athlete and one of the best in the game today is quite the impressive backfield. In my mind you can’t dispute Emmitt Smith as the RB1 here. His leadership and toughness alone earn him the top spot, but the all-time leading rusher as well? There’s no denying him the starting job. Putting Zeke third over other great Cowboys backs such as Calvin Hill was a tough choice, but his career is off to a great start. As other fans have pointed out, it was really a miss to not include FB Moose Johnston here, so he replaces Herschel Walker.

|Position/depth|Name|Years with Cowboys|
:--|:--|:--|
|RB1|*Emmitt Smith*|1990-2002|
|RB2|*Tony Dorsett*|1977-1987|
|RB3|Ezekiel Elliot|2016-Present|
|RB4/FB|Daryl ""Moose"" Johnston|1989-1999|

**Wide Receiver:** Many will wonder: why no T.O.? For starters, his longevity as a Cowboy compared to the rest of his career had to be taken into account (this will come back on defense later). Secondly, this squad is an impressive group even without him. 3-time Super Bowl champion Michael Irvin leads the charge, while the franchise leader in touchdown catches, Dez Bryant, plays opposite him. When a two-time Olympic Gold Medalist sprinter is your WR5, you don’t have much of a problem at the position. And Alvin Harper's catch in the '92 NFC championship is one of the greatest in team history, so he gets an honorable nod.

|Position/depth|Name|Years with Cowboys|
:--|:--|:--|
|WR1|*Michael Irvin*|1988-1999|
|WR2|Dez Bryant|2010-2017|
|WR3|Drew Pearson|1973-1983|
|WR4|Tony Hill|1977-1986|
|WR5|*Bob Hayes*|1965-1974|
|WR6|Alvin Harper|1991-1994|

**Tight End:** Despite having one of the best in the history of the game in Jason Witten, this group leaves some to be desired. There’s not a whole ton of depth behind him. I love Jay Novacek as a player, but this group doesn’t compare with some of the others on the team.

|Position/depth|Name|Years with Cowboys|
:--|:--|:--|
|TE1|Jason Witten|2003-2017; 2019|
|TE2|Jay Novacek|1990-1995|
|TE3|Billy Joe DuPree|1973-1983|
|TE4|*Mike Ditka*|1969-1972|

**Offensive Line:** I’d contest the offensive line is the best position group on the field for the all-time Cowboys. Put these guys anywhere on the line, in any era, and they will dominate. This was a very difficult group to rank, as old-school offensive line play is very difficult to keep track of outside of reputation. The stats just aren’t there. But this group would instill fear in any opposing defensive line.

|Position/depth|Name|Years with Cowboys|

|OT1|*Rayfield Wright*|1967-1979|
|OT2|Tyron Smith|2011-Present|
|OT3|Mark Tuinei|1983-1997|
|OT4|Erik Williams|1991-2000|

Statistics must be taken with a grain of salt. But, when they stand out over the course of a decade, it's something to take note of.

Some of these numbers hold up as the gold standard over the course of NFL history (Manning, Brees, Johnson).

These are the most impressive single-season statistical performances over the past decade:

The best offensive players for this team are really only Jeremy Shockey and Clinton Portis.  This is one of the few times an All Draft Team doesn’t have some kind of HOF caliber offensive weapon.


The Defense, however, is deceptively good.  At first glance the defense looks decent but let’s take a closer look.  Two different Defensive Players of the Years in Reed and Harrison, two edge rushers with 100+ sacks, Haynesworth was amazing in his early year, and Roy Willams was one of the best Cowboy players in the early 2000s.  Even the 3 starting Cornerback, though they lack the accolades, were all long term starters for their respective teams.


Speaking of this defense’s players I believe that there are 3 other HOFers that get elected besides Ed Reed.  Julius Peppers will be a first ballot HOFer.  Dwight Freeney should be a first ballot guy but probably waits a year or two.  James Harrison, in my opinion, shouldn’t be a first ballot guy but probably will be because the voters love those Steelers players. HOF Voters don’t like Safeties or Centers so I doubt Andre Gurode or Roy Williams get in and frankly they probably shouldn’t.

Hello everyone,

As of today, there are 21 days left until the first round of the NFL Draft begins, and this is a continuation of my countdown to the draft, where I will be outlining the best players taken at each draft slot from 32 to 1. Today is the 21st overall pick, which is currently held by the Seahawks this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 21st overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Randy Moss|WR|1998|MIN|161|HOF
Vince Wilfork|DT|2004|NE|117|
Richie Petitbon|S|1959|CHI|109|AV not recorded before 1960
Jerry Robinson|LB|1979|PHI|93|

One guy's goto move is the source PFF religiously, but I just cant take him seriously. I have seen too many WTF rankings from them to even go down that road. I know they are trying to push the envelope and throw out stats that havent really been tried before, but I cant reliably trust them. For example, at one point in the season, they had Gore and Carson on the #2 and #3 backs on the year. Or, they have Trubisky ranked down near Peterman levels. 

So, it got me thinking, who is a source that we can trust for analysis? Does it exist? DVOA seems to do a decent job with lining up to on field performance. 

I know its much easier to rank players in other leagues, like baseball, due to it being a more individual sport. Maybe this isnt possible for the NFL? ",nfl

670,"Why would the Cardinals keep GM Steve Keim if they were to trade Josh Rosen and take Kyler Murray at #1?
To preface this: I do not think the Cardinals will trade Rosen and take Murray. And I know most people here have said the same thing and think a lot of the mock drafts are just doing it for views/clicks. This is just an evaluation on if the scenario were to happen.

With the draft approaching and plenty of professional journalists mocking Kyler Murray to the Cardinals, I thought I’d pose this question: Why would Keim he kept around if the idea is to start fresh with a new HC and a new QB?

Looking over his drafts from 2013 (his first season) to 2017 (holding off on 2018 for now) the best players he’s drafted are Tyrann Matheiu and David Johnson, two players elite at their respective position. After that he has a mix of decent to good players in John Brown, Markus Golden, and Budda Baker. Other than that, there have been some bad picks. 2016 is possibly his worst year with essentially no starting players taken. 2017 had Baker in the 2nd, but disappointing or average-at-best players taken everywhere else.

Then we have free agency and trades. He did manage to acquire the elite LB Chandler Jones from the Patriots in exchange for a 2nd round pick and OG Jonathan Cooper (a disappointing player taken in the 1st in 2013). He also picked up Carson Palmer in 2013, who would go on to have above average to great years in AZ. Other than that, Keim hasn’t really attracted any “big name” players. He cut Tyrann Matheiu, which at the time seemed to be the right decision (and one I agreed with last year), who went on to have a pretty good year with the Texans and got paid a top contract with the Chiefs. Keim opted to sign Sam Bradford, who played horrible and was cut halfway through the season. This while also hiring Steve Wilks as HC, who is subsequently fired at year’s end.

This now brings us to Rosen and the rest of the 2018 class. For the most part, this could be a decent draft. If Rosen improves and builds chemistry with Christian Kirk, Mason Cole continues to “mesh” with the rest of the Offensive Line and they stay healthy, and Chase Edmonds serves as a good RB2, all of which I think are possible, I think Keim should receive credit for that and remain with the Cardinals for the time being.

Now in 2019, the Cardinals hire “offensive guru” Kliff Kingsbury as HC and have the #1 overall pick and rumors are flying around about them trading Rosen so they can instead take Kyler Murray. The Cardinals opted to keep Keim after he signed an extension the previous year and have him help build the roster with free agents. There weren’t any big signings, which was expected since the Cardinals didn’t have much cap space to make any big moves (NOTE: I haven’t looked into how much this has to do with Keim and how he structured contracts).

So here we are with the hypothetical that the Cardinals will trade Josh Rosen for a rumored 2nd or 3rd round pick so that they can take Kyler Murray at #1. This wild mean that Keim doesn’t believe that Rosen can improve much and essentially traded a 1st, a 3rd, and a 5th in 2018 for a hypothetical 2nd/3rd in 2019 (I know it’s not as simple as that but bear with me). This also means that he misevaluated Rosen last year and wasted a 1st round pick to get him.

So to rephrase my question: Wouldn’t Keim have been fired earlier this year, before free agency started and the draft was approaching, if the Cardinals’ plan is to “start fresh” with a new HC and QB? Why not start fresh with a new GM more aligned with the new HC’s philosophy instead of keeping somebody who hasn’t really done much? Do you think keeping Keim is evidence towards keeping Rosen and passing on Murray?

TL;DR: Steve Keim has been, at best, a mediocre GM. There really wouldn’t be a reason to keep him if the Cardinals actually wanted to “start fresh” with a new HC by trading Rosen and picking Murray at #1.",nfl

677,"Has there ever been a more even division in NFL history than the 2002 AFC East?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_NFL_season

In 2002, the New England Patriots were coming off their first Super Bowl win in franchise history, and would win two more in the next two years. 

But in 2002, not only did they not win the Super Bowl, they didn’t even manage to win their division, beaten out by Chad Pennington and the mighty New York Jets, who finished 9-7 after starting the year 1-4 with Vinny Testaverde under center.

The Patriots also finished 9-7 that year, good for second place. This also marks the last time they would finish a season with single digit wins since. And I’m sure I don’t need to fill you in on the rest.

The Miami Dolphins decided to take the opposite approach to the season as the Jets. Having started the year 5-1, they looked to be in good shape, but due to losing starting quarterback Jay Fiedler to a broken thumb for 6 games and losing 4 of them, they limped to a 9-7 record and a third place finish. The one bright spot on the team was newly acquired running back Ricky Williams, who finished with 1,853 yards and 16 touchdowns on the ground.

Last but not least, the Buffalo Bills. Having acquired Drew Bledsoe on draft day from the Patriots, the Bills were hoping for a rejuvenated offense in 2002, and at first, they got what they wanted. Over the first eight games, they scored at least 23 points (and over 30 in five of those), and came away with 5 wins. In the last eight games however, the offense sputtered, only managing to score 23+ points twice and going 3-5 over that span. They would finish the season 8-8 and in last place. 

Since the 2002 season, the division has been anything but even. The Patriots have won 15 of 16 division titles (the Dolphins** managed to win in 2008 when Brady was injured), and have won 5 Super Bowls. The rest of the division has managed 5 playoff wins total (all by the Jets). 

To recap, the final standings for the 2002 AFC East were as follows:

1. New York Jets (9-7) - Division Winner
2. New England Patriots (9-7)
3. Miami Dolphins (9-7)
4. Buffalo Bills (8-8)

Who needs a great defense when you have this offense?  Every single QB, RB, and WR is at least a Pro Bowler.  The starting QB, RB, and top two receivers are all HOF level players.  This offense would dominate so many games.  Oh and hey that defense isn’t too shabby either.  The Defensive Line is stacked Linebackers are good DBs are all players who were longtime starters in the League.  This team would be super fun to watch play.


Obviously Drew Brees is going into the HOF.  I thin Steve Smith is the only first ballot HOF receiver but Reggie Wayne and Chad Ochocinco should both get in eventually.  Steve Hutchinson should get in eventually as well.  Richard Seymour and Justin Smith are probably both delayed because they didn’t break 100 sacks but with the amount of ProBowls/All-Pros they have it would be a shame if neither of them made it.

705,"The Best Team, Coaching Staff and Coaching Tree No One Ever Talks About
The USFL doesn't get mentioned much anymore outside of minor trivia bits, like a team being owned by Trump, Flutie and Herschel Walker starring there, or their status as a forerunner in failure to each latest pro football league to open to a big fanfare then fall flat on their face. Very few remember that during the leagues three year run it was completely dominated by a team of no names called the Stars.

 In three USFL seasons the Stars put together a 48-13-1 record, appeared in all three title games, won two Championships and lost the third by only two points. The team, which played initially in Philadelphia then later in Baltimore was put together by first time General Manager Carl Peterson. Peterson, who had been a scout under Dick Vermeil with the Eagles would go on to serve as the Kansas City Chiefs long time GM. He brought Schottenheimer, Christian Okoye, Derrick Thomas, Will Shields, Willie Roaf, Tony Gonzalez, Priest Holmes and Joe Montana into the organization during his tenure there. 

 When Peterson was hired he put together a leadership group led by Assistant GM Bill Kuharich and Head Coach George Perles. Kuharich would go on to serve as the Director of Player Personnel of the Saints under Jim Finks, then as the GM of the Saints before serving as Director of Player Personnel again under Peterson in Kansas City. 

 Perles never coached a game with the Stars, bailing when he was offered the head coaching job at Michigan State. On very short notice Peterson hired an unknown defensive line coach from the Patriots named Jim Mora to replace him. With very little time to work with Mora put his coaching staff together mostly with young assistants from the college ranks. 

 On the offensive side the staff wasn't very memorable, with RB Coach Jim Skipper the only one to make a major impact on the NFL. Skipper was on Mora's Saints staff in the 80's and 90's, the Giants in the late 90's and has had a nearly 20 year run with the Panthers as their RB Coach since 2002. The defensive side was different, Mora was able to pull coaches from the CFL and college and put together what would become an all star group on that side of the ball.

 Mora's Defensive Coordinator was Vince Tobin, hired from the CFL. Tobin is known best as the head coach of the Cardinals during a forgettable five year run in the 90's, but after the Stars folded he was the hired by the Bears to replace Buddy Ryan in 1986 and he kept the Bears defense playing at an elite level for the rest of that decade.

  The Stars Defensive Line Coach was John Pease. Pease followed Mora to the Saints, then joined Tom Coughlin's staff in Jacksonville serving as both D Line Coach and Coordinator. The Stars job was Pease first with a pro team.

 The Stars LB Coach was Vic Fangio in his first job coaching a pro team. Fangio would go on to serve as the LB Coach of the Dome Patrol Saints before being hired as the Defensive Coordinator of the expansion Carolina Panthers. He rejoined Mora in Indianapolis as defensive coordinator and figured prominently in Mora's firing by GM Polian. Fangio went on to several other stops as a defensive coordinator, including the 49ers and Bears where he raised both units to elite status before finally being offered a head coaching job this year. 

 The Stars DB Coach was also a young coach with no pro experience named Dom Capers. Reddit knows Capers mainly as the guy who was blamed for all the Packers troubles before McCarthy was the guy who was blamed for all the Packers troubles. Older redditors will remember Capers was once looked at as the brightest defensive mind in the game. He followed Mora to the Saints where he coached DB's through the Dome Patrol years, then was hired as the Steelers Defensive Coordinator after Tony Dungy left. There he pushed the more attacking style of play he had learned under Mora and his staff. 

 Capers was head coach of two expansion teams, the Panthers and Texans before returning to DC duties with the Dolphins and Packers. When he took the Panthers job he was replaced as Steelers DC by another Mora assistant, LB coach Jim Haslett who later returned to the Saints as head coach where he won the first playoff game in franchise history. Capers had been replaced on the Saints staff as DB coach by Mora's son Jim  Mora Jr., who would go on to a head coaching position with the Falcons.

 If you are keeping track the Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars had 4 defensive coaches on staff. All but one was hired by Mora for their first coaching job with a pro team, the other from the CFL. All 4 served as defensive coordinators of top 10 NFL defenses, and 3 of the 4 served as head coaches in Arizona, Carolina, Houston, and now with Fangio finally getting the call, Denver. Additionally, two coaches who served under Mora on the defensive side with the Saints, Jim Haslett and Jim Mora Jr., also became NFL defensive coordinators and head coaches, with each fielding playoff teams. 

 When Mora took over the Colts he hired longtime Chuck Noll assistant Tom Moore to run the offense, and (in his 2nd year there) longtime Saints and Stars assistant Vic Fangio to run the defense. He only brought two other coaches with him from the Saints. One was defensive coach John Pagano, currently with the Texans. The other was a young coach Mora had hired late in his Saints run from Mississippi State to coach his Tight Ends named Bruce Arians. Arians got the job as QB coach to Peyton Manning, and eventually got a head coaching job with the Cardinals, who he coached to a Superbowl. 

 **6 coaches who worked for Mora went on to be NFL head coaches. In most cases Mora hired them from college teams and they had NFL careers due to working with him.**

 **Vince Tobin** Mora's DC with the Stars, went on to coach the NFL's best defense with the Bears and was head coach of the Cardinals.

 **Vic Fangio** Mora's LB Coach with the Stars and Saints and DC with the Colts, DC for 49ers teams that played in 3 straight NFC Championship games and one Superbowl and Bears defense that was NFL's #1 Scoring defense last year current Denver head coach.

 **Dom Capers** Mora's DB Coach with the Stars and Saints, returned the Steelers defense to elite status as DC, Head Coach of Panthers and Texans, coached Panthers into NFC Championship Game in teams second year of existence.

 **Jim Haslett** Mora LB Coach who took over as Steelers DC after Capers, kept the same attacking 3-4 philosophy Capers had learned under Mora with the Stars and Saints and served as Saints head coach producing the teams first ever playoff win. 

**Jim Mora Jr** Took over as DB coach in New Orleans after Capers, served as 49ers DC before being hired by Atlanta to coach during the Michael Vick era where he took the team from 5-11 to 11-5 and an NFC Championship Game appearance.

 **Bruce Arians** hired out of college as an offensive assistant by Mora he eventually worked his way from Pittsburgh to Arizona where he coached the Cardinals to the NFC Championship Game, he is currently Tampa Bay's Head Coach. 

 **Special Mention: Sam Mills** He never served as an NFL Head Coach but that was due to his untimely death, Mills was already being talked up as a head coach during his short time as a coach with Carolina. Mills was Mora's defensive Captain with both the Stars and the Saints and played under him for over a decade so even though he didn't coach under Mora or get a head coaching job before he passed away he deserves a place on Mora's tree.

 Jim Mora has never really been acknowledged as one of the NFL coaches with a legit coaching tree. Maybe now with Fangio finally getting the call in Denver it's time to change that. But maybe the Stars should get their due here too. After all whether it's the Saints Dome Patrol defense, the Steelers version of the attacking 3-4 Dom Capers brought from New Orleans, all of the Mora assistants who went on to have great track records as coordinators of top 10 NFL defenses and head coaches of playoff teams, all of it started in Philadelphia with a rookie head coach, a group of young college coaches who signed on with him trying to break into the pros, and the Dogpound Defense they built and dominated USFL with.

You may remember him from his always thoughtful “View From the Couch” and “View From the Press Box” series he wrote on r/Buccaneers and his syndicated column in SportsTalkFlorida (real name: Tim Williams, which he was comfortable sharing when he was still with us).

Tim was also r/NFL's weekly power ranking contributor for the Buccaneers and had also partaken in the top 100 players series. 

I decided to look up Tim’s work this morning to see what he’d been up to, if he’d moved on to another publication since he hadn’t been active here in a few months and [came across this article written by his uncle](https://www.sportstalkflorida.com/college/all-the-best-from-tim-williams-a-life-well-lived-but-cut-way-too-short/) It turns out Tim left us in December.

I will always remember Tim for his always thoughtful posts. His comments were always intricately thought out and full of insight, he had a ravenous appreciation for all things sports, and he was one of the few remaining great long-form journalists.

Please share your memories of Tim here. If I can find any more information about charities/fundraisers in his memory, I will share with the sub.

Today is the 22nd overall pick, which is currently held by the Ravens this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 22nd overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Jack Reynolds|LB|1970|LAR|108|

728,"Does the NFL have a stat like the MLB's WAR and if not do you think it would be of benefit?
For anyone who doesn't know what the stat is, WAR stands for Wins Above Replacement. It’s an amalgam of various stats rolled into one figure that analyzes a players estimated number of wins that they would directly contribute to over someone playing in their position. 

What got me thinking on this was all of the Bryce Harper talk that went around about if he was worth is contract or not. Now I know QBs in the nfl have QBR and Rating but those aren’t quite the same stat. 

I understand if you applied the same logic behind WAR to an nfl stat, qbs would far and away be the main beneficiaries of the stat. However I see a lot of value in grading everyone outside of the qb position by this sort of stat. 

The ideal situation would especially be at play during this time of year where free agent contracts can be boom or bust. 

What is your opinion or do you know of a stat like this?

Btw, I understand PFF tracks a lot of interesting stats but I never found one that mirrored the stat that I have in mind. ",nfl

740,"[OC] Why a ""99/41"" reception slash line is the magic number for draft-eligible WRs
I’ve done plenty of magic number posts on QBs before. Last week, I even continued this trend by [looking at bad games by QBs and whether that was an indicator of success in the NFL](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/b5oq1g/oc_how_concerning_is_it_if_a_qb_has_a_bad_game_in/?st=jtxtj9fu&amp;sh=473fcea0). But up until this point, QB was the only position that I’ve done this for. I’ve never done it for anything else.

That changes today. Wide receivers, you’re on the block.

With the quarterback position, not a lot of them tend to get drafted on a yearly basis. With wide receivers, however, the numbers are off the charts most years. In 2018, there were 33 wide receivers taken, which was the most of any position on the offensive side of the ball, and more than the number of tight ends, offensive guards, and centers combined. Over the past three drafts, there have been 98 wide receivers taken. On average, most teams take at least one wide receivers in any given draft.

So with so many wide receiver prospects out there, is there any way we can tell if a receiver is going to be any good or not? Let’s look at the magic number to determine wide receiver success in the NFL.

**Part I: The Formula**

Much like the last magic number post, I looked at every WR to get drafted since the 2001 NFL Draft. This is because much like the last time, College Reference does not have any game logs for college prior to the 2000 season. Any data prior to 2000 when it comes to collegiate athletics is spotty at best, so this is just a nice, clean cut-off.

I should point out that this is two magic numbers, and not just one. **The magic number slash line is 99/41.** You’re probably wondering what that means, and it’s pretty simple. **If a receiver had less than 99 career receptions in college AND never had a season with more than 41 receptions, they were placed on the list.** This is a two-parter for a reason. The first part indicates how much success a receiver has had in college overall. If a receiver has less than 99 career receptions, then they weren’t exactly a dominant force over their entire collegiate career. However, the 41-reception criteria is to prevent receivers who had dominant seasons, or receivers who transferred, from being on the list. I don’t want to penalize a receiver who was buried on the depth chart, finally got his chance to start, and had 75 receptions the following season. This is a case of how dominant were you over your career, and how dominant were you at your peak. If you’re under both of these numbers, you’re on the list.

Having said that, there are a few qualifications for this magic number:

- The player in question had to be drafted as a wide receiver. This makes sense, since we’re looking at how the receiving skillset will translate in the NFL. As an example, Penn State wide receiver Ethan Kilmer was drafted by the Bengals in the 7th round of the 2006 NFL Draft. However, he was drafted to play defense; he never even saw a snap at wide receiver in the NFL. If they were drafted to play a position other than WR in the NFL, then they’re not on the list.

- Their final season had to be at a Division I (FBS/I-A) school. Finding stats for lower divisions as you go further and further back is unreliable. Prior to the year that they got drafted, they had to be playing at the highest level that college football has to offer.

- Their final season in college had to be at WR. For example, Julian Edelman does not count; even though he falls below both of those numbers, that’s because he played QB for Kent State and never actually played wide receiver. How a player translates to a completely different position is a completely different topic.

- And finally, the player had to play at least two seasons at the Division I (FBS/I-A) level in total. If they played two seasons, with one being at one position and one being at wide receiver, then that counts. But they had to spend more than a year playing at the highest level of college football.

With all of that being said, what 21st century wide receivers fit this criteria?

**Part II: The Historic List**

Prepare yourselves, because it’s a long list. Here’s all of the guys to get drafted since 2001 that had less than 99 career receptions and never had a season with more than 41 receptions. Let’s see how they panned out. Note that if a WR from 2017 or 2018 is on the list, I’m only going to say that player is a bust if that player is no longer on the team, since it takes three years to truly evaluate a draft and a pick.

2001 | Cedric James | TCU | 41 | 19 | R4, P131- Minnesota | Had 1 reception for 29 yards in 2002 with the Vikings, which was the only reception of his career

2001 | Chris Taylor | Texas A&amp;M | 83 | 33 | R7, P218- Pittsburgh | Has 0 career receptions
2001 | Andre King | Miami (FL) | 64 | 28 | R7, P245- Cleveland | Had 30 receptions for 327 yards over his career

**Part III: The Analysis**

There’s 61 receivers on this list. As a whole, these 61 receivers combine for 1,546 receptions and 20,507 yards. Jerry Rice by himself had 1,549 receptions and 22,895 yards. Jerry Rice had better numbers than all 61 of these receivers combined. However, to expect any team to draft a player of Jerry Rice’s caliber is unrealistic; if you can hit a home run like that in the draft and get a Hall of Fame player, then kudos. So let’s break down these numbers in a way that doesn’t stack up against the greatest receiver of the modern era.

- On average, a 21st century receiver that fits this criteria will finish their career with 25 career receptions and 336 career receiving yards

- 17 of these 61 receivers finished their career with 0 receptions. An additional 5 receivers finished their career with 1 reception, and another 11 receivers finished with less than 10 receptions. Of the 61 receivers on this list, 33 of them (over half) had single-digit receptions across their entire careers

- These 61 receivers have combined for 0 Pro Bowl appearances and 0 All-Pro selections 

- Only 3 receivers on this list finished their career with 100+ receptions. Legedu Naanee finished with 108, David Givens finished with 166, and Louis Murphy finished with 170

- Only 2 receivers on this list had over 1,300 receiving yards. Louis Murphy had 2,443, and David Givens had 2,318. 

- I know there are going to be some people who said that a lot of these guys were drafted in the sixth and seventh rounds, so they shouldn’t be expected to contribute. But guys drafted early on definitely have that expectation. There were 5 receivers in the second round taken: DJ Chark (Jacksonville), Stephen Hill (NY Jets), Sinorice Moss (NY Giants), Mark Bradley (Chicago), and Tim Carter (NY Giants). These 5 receivers combined for 271 receptions and 3,562 yards. On average, that’s 54 career receptions and 712 career receiving yards. A second round pick is expected to put up more than that on a seasonal basis, and that’s what they’re averaging across their entire careers

**Part IV: Who to Avoid**

We’ve established the fact that if you draft a 21st century receiver that checks off all of these boxes, that the odds of them panning out are about as good as finding a needle in a haystack, or about as good as finding someone who genuinely enjoyed the Up with People halftime shows. So which wide receivers at the FBS level meet this criteria? Which receivers didn’t have a season with 42+ receptions, didn’t have a career with at least 99 receptions, and should be avoided because of this?

Jay MacIntyre | Colorado | 88 | 32
Ryan Schadler | Kansas | 21 | 21
Jesse Jackson | Mississippi State | 37 | 27
Jerrod Heard | Texas | 58 | 24

I took a look at every receiver on [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bu7VCs3ld5efCR3fDjj_vM09KjYbY_SBDkdJHRJPOew/edit?usp=sharing), which is an absolute godsend if you want to watch film on any prospect. Obviously, there are some guys on this list that have no shot at getting drafted, and there are some guys on here that might not even get a look for a rookie tryout. However, there are some guys that are projected to go super high in this draft, including workout warrior DK Metcalf. After his ridiculously good combine testing in some categories, he shot up many boards. Just keep in mind that he’s on a list where the best receivers are David Givens, Louis Murphy, and Legedu Naanee.

**Part V: Conclusion**

A player can be incredibly productive in college and not pan out in the NFL. However, the point of some of these magic numbers is to judge whether or not an unproductive college player can be successful in the NFL. And, judging by the list of 61 receivers drafted in the 21st century that combined for no Pro Bowls, no All-Pros, no 1,000-yard seasons, and usually average less than 350 career receiving yards, the answer seems to be no. There’s a few guys in there that are rotational options, but nobody on that list ever came close to being a WR1; arguably the only WR2 on the list was David Givens for a season or two. If a player falls below both magic numbers, their chances of success in the NFL are not good.

**TL;DR:** Don’t draft WRs who had less than 99 career receptions and never had a season with at least 42 receptions. They’ll likely be bad.

748,"[OC] Imagining a 2020 NFL realignment (diagrams linked inside)
Thanks to the suggestion of u/pdx-Psych and the encouragement of u/Real_Muthsera I decided to create my own divisional realignment for the 2020 NFL season that makes a little bit more sense geographically while trying to maintain division rivalries.  If you want the TL;DR version see the entire post [here](https://imgur.com/a/GHSHgf0).  
  
The combined [AFC and NFC map](https://imgur.com/fLiGQH1) works out pretty nicely (except fuck Kansas City, Denver, and Seattle in particular).  To see things a little more clearly I separated them out into an [AFC only map](https://imgur.com/T4rkKXS) and a [NFC only map](https://imgur.com/lp74npu).  
  
I also decided to make a hypothetical [scheduling diagram](https://imgur.com/KFXIQNX) for these new divisions.  One thing to note, however, is that I’m ignoring the 2019 NFL season and the previous NFL scheduling pattern.  For example, in 2020 the Eagles are supposed to be playing the NFC West, but I have them playing the NFC South in order to allow for more “rivalry games” e.g. Cowboys and Panthers get to play against their previous divisions.  
  
For anyone who doesn’t know how NFL schedules are created I’ll give a brief description.  Each team will play 6 games against opponents within their division, two games against each team (teams within your same circle on the diagram).  A team will also play against another division within the same conference (teams grouped by dotted lines).  A team will also play against another division from the opposing conference (matching colored circles).  And finally a team will play two games against a matching ranked team from the same conference that they haven’t already played (matching numbers).  This is based on how your team finished the previous season within your division.  So, for example, the Patriots finished first in the AFC East and therefore would have to play the Chiefs and Texans who both won their divisions.  
  
I also created a [spreadsheet](https://imgur.com/i0kwafH) to list every team’s opponents.  If enough people are interested I could create a theoretical schedule for the season showing the games each week, which teams are home/away, and highlight the significant matchups; it would just take a lot more work so I haven’t gotten to that yet.  But hopefully r/NFL finds this proposition interesting!  Do you guys think it would make sense to realign the teams like this for 2020 when the Raiders move to Las Vegas?  Or should things remain the same?

First off I want to apologize for how long this is but I want to explain my choices because there are some different choices in this list. This is based off impact to the team in history, stats are important but secondary, but with that said here we go.

QUARTERBACKS
QB1: Len Dawson
QB2: Joe Montana 
QB3: Alex Smith

This was difficult because as much as I want to put Patrick Mahomes in this list already I can’t. One season doesn’t equate to an all time great. Len won our first (and only) Super Bowl against a dominant Vikings D, its Montana magic man I mean he gave the Chiefs hope in a confusing time at qb and gave them a near super bowl, and Alex Smith took the team from the depths and turned them into a yearly playoff contender instantly putting up above average numbers in multiple seasons and bringing Andy Reid’s offense to life.

RUNNING BACKS
RB1: Jamaal Charles
RB2: Christian Okoye
RB3: Marcus Allen/Priest Holmes/Joe Delaney

I’ll admit I cheated on RB3, but in my defense the running back position is stacked throughout KC’s history so make your choice there. RB1 goes to the rushing leader and a man who was the shining spot on the chiefs offense through the dark years. RB2 wasn’t hard for me as Okoye was dominant in his era and, barring 1 Atwater hit, was unstoppable.

FULLBACK
FB1: Tony Richardson/Anthony Sherman

Too easy, both were/are cemented and make the respective offenses they helped deadlier by adding a forgotten weapon.

WIDE RECEIVER
WR1: Otis Taylor
WR2: Dwayne Bowe
WR3: Henry Marshall
WR4: Tyreek Hill
WR5: Eddie Kennison

Otis Taylor is another member of the super bowl champion Chiefs and was dominant his entire career, Bowe is the all time leader for yards amongst receivers and played very well despite having a disastrous QB scenario, Marshall played during the slump (1972-1986) and despite this put up respectable numbers for the time, Tyreek Hill is the Chiefs premier threat and over his first three years has given KC a multiple threat player with a run speed of 23 mph at the fastest, and last is Eddie Kennison who was another target for Trent green in a daunting Vermeil era offense.

Tight end 
TE1: Tony Gonzalez
TE2: Travis Kelce
TE3: Fred Arbanas

Hate his comments as you will but Tony G is the best Chiefs fans. His level of play and stats combined provide a record of unstoppable play. Kelce over Arbanas was hard but it was the right choice in my mind as he has been a force since he was drafted and shows no signs of slowing down. Arbanas had to be here as he was a favorite for targets during his career with the Chiefs with Len Dawson at the helm.

O-LINE
RT: Jim Tyrer
RG: Brian Waters
C: Tim Grunhard
LG: Will Shields
LT: Willie Roaf

The research on this is hard because of the position and I’ll be honest it’s the least accurate of the list because of how much film you have to watch on these players to be on point. This is the best I could find because of the limited time and the fact that stat sheets it turns out are almost non existent. My apologies Chiefs Kingdom.

DEFENSIVE LINE
DL1: Buck Buchanan
DL2: Bobby Bell
DL3: Neil Smith
DL4: Jared Allen

The defensive line history has a few stars I could find in my research but it’s thin. Both Buchanan and Bell were anchors on the early chiefs defense that dismantled the Vikings in SBIV. On the same line as the late Derrick Thomas Neil Smith was instrumental in a pass rush that methodically picked apart O-Lines in the 90’s. Jared Allen was drafted by KC and rose to superstar heights before leaving for Minnesota.

OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS
OLB1: Derrick Thomas
OLB2: Jim Lynch 
OLB3: Justin Houston
OLB4: Tamba Hali

Honestly I was shocked when I did my research on how many no name OLB’s the chiefs have had. DT was the man, unstoppable in all facets he was a terror to quarterbacks. Still holding the single game sack record to this day (7) he hold a legacy in KC. Another member of the SBIV champion squad lynch gave the chiefs a presence on the outside and as cheap as it sounds the tape says it all. Justin Houston’s time in KC has ended but what he did while he was here was important, he gave Kansas City another game breaker on the outside and put up record numbers in sacks for a single season. Though Tamba didn’t set records like Houston or Thomas he did provide KC with a powerhouse on the edge and was a vicious presence throughout the majority of his career

MIDDLE LINEBACKERS
MLB1: Willie Lanier
MLB2: Gary Spani
MLB3: Derrick Johnson

It’s Willie Lanier, household name in KC and yet another member of a stud defense in the 60’s and 70’s. He’s a 6x pro-bowler man and as far as the history of the position in KC he’s the top choice. Though not as well known to other teams Spani held the chiefs tackles record at 999 tackles for close to 30 years before the next choice Derrick Johnson captured the title. Johnson was everything you want in a MLB a quality leader, high football IQ, and a sure tackle putting him with these men as #3.

CORNERBACKS
CB1: Emmit Thomas
CB2: Albert Lewis

If we could put safeties at corner I would but this group is thiiiiiiiin. Emmit Thomas is a hall of Famer who helped KC win a super bowl. Albert Lewis was a notable presence at corner and was perfect when in tandem with Deron Cherry.

SAFETY
S1: Johnny Robinson
S2: Deron Cherry
S3: Eric Berry

The three “proud eras” in chiefs history give us another set of players. Though I didn’t review a lot of Robinson’s tape his stats and hall of fame induction can’t lie and it’s a shame it took that long to do. Deron Cherry anchored a secondary in the 80’s and early 90’s with the previously mentioned Lewis. He beat cancer and won comeback player of the year... Berry has been an inspiration to everyone in the kingdom and though his departure was bitter for all of us he changed the franchise while he was here and gave us all he had.

KICKER
K: Jan Stenerud

PUNTER
P: Dustin Colquitt

KICK/PUNT RETURN SPECIALIST
KR/PR: Dante Hall

It was a mistake not adding this position as the human joystick gave us so many memorable moments at this position. From making Denver defenders tackle each other with jukes to running back into the end zone and making an entire coverage team miss he was undoubtably one of the most exciting players to wear that uniform. But it’s as a return specialist that he’s more widely remembered.


HEAD COACH
1. Hank Stram
2. Andy Reid
3. Dick Vermeil

This team is pretty solid.  The Offense is pretty good with two Pro Bowl Tackles and an amazing RB.  The receivers aren’t great but that’s way Brady likes it.  The defensive front is super stacked there are several DE and LBs that got left off purely due to roster size.  The Defensive Backs are average.  


If Tom Brady ever retires he is going into the HOF.   I also think John Abraham gets in but probably not first ballot.  Shane Lechler will get into the Hall as well.  Shaun Alexander may get in as well but not for awhile yet.

809,"Does it make sense for Arizona to trade out of #1?
With this years draft class, I'm not sure what they would stand to convert that #1 to by trading back.  I don't think there is anyone high on a particular prospect to net a huge haul for a top-level player.  I don't see anyone offering an RG3 level package (three firsts and a second) to move up on a player, even a potential franchise QB.  I think the valuation of picks is made even more confusing with the recency of AB going for a 3rd and a 5th despite the circus that preceded it.  What say you r/nfl?

825,"Georgia Tech Rbs and the Triple option
This is more of a general football question but it relates to the NFL. 

Can anyone that knows more about the game explain why we don't see more RBs out of Georgia Tech in the NFL? I understand they call their Rbs A and B backs, but I have to wonder if the triple option makes these backs undesirable in that it doesn't adequately prepare them for a traditional offense. 

Oddly enough there have been more WRs drafted from Georgia Tech since 2010 than Rbs, and if you have ever watched them play you will know that the forward pass takes an act of God to execute properly in that offense, so I find that strange.

On a side note, Georgia Tech will finally put an end to the triple option this year. It's kind of sad because it was like watching a relic from another time. They we're by far the largest program to still run it.",nfl

848,"A personnel executive who works in pro scouting on Josh Rosen‘s poor rookie season: “Just a bad situation for a rookie QB. You definitely saw the good, in why they drafted him. He processes and learns it well, but people keep questioning toughness and leadership.”

&gt;“I think it was a mix of both. He’s definitely talented and, from a quarterbacking stand, he can do everything you need him to. He was hindered by the lack of weapons around him, the lack of protection he had. But when he started to get hit, you’d question his overall toughness. He started to look at the rush, you could tell he didn’t want to be hit anymore. Then, what didn’t help was the change in coordinator, and that the next coordinator couldn’t put in his own offense, because everything was on the fly. … Just a bad situation for a rookie quarterback. You definitely saw the good, in why they drafted him. No one questions the physical ability. It’s the mental part of it. He processes and learns it well, but people keep questioning toughness and leadership.”",nfl

&gt;“That was one of the first things we talked about [in the interview with the Jets]. I don’t think I’ll ever change from that.

887,"/r/NFL Top 100 List
Hey everyone, Welcome to the /r/NFL's Top 100 List! We listened to some community feedback over the last year and wanted to stress the **importance** of each position. This means that the Quarterback position was given much more weight that other positions in people's lists (except for /u/Maad-Dog, of course). We also listened that people were burnt out by the end when we did weekly posts, so we posted it all in one list! We are really proud of the list this year!

For those wondering why it is so early this year, we wanted to get the list out between FA and the Draft when there are still people on the subreddit but it's still a bit slow.

#The Top 10

|Rank|Player|Position|Write Up|
--:|:--|:--|:--|
|10|Ben Roethlisberger|QB|Starting off our top ten, we have one of the greatest QBs in the game today in Ben Roethlisberger. Ben led the league in completions, attempts, yards, and yards per game; clearly demonstrating his superior play to most players this year. Even though he had to carry a regressing Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell-less rushing attack, [as well as face constant pressure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t00Vt2_zw9o) he still managed to have the most prolific passing season in the NFL. His phenomenal leadership ability was the icing on the cake in locking in his place in the top ten.|
|9|Kirk Cousins|QB|Next on our list is the prize of the last offseason, Kirk Cousins. After signing a revolutionary 3-year, 84-million, fully guaranteed, regardless of performance, contract with the Vikings, Cousins took the NFL by storm. Despite only having fifth-round picks and undrafted wide receivers to throw to, Kirk posted an incredible (approximately) 4,300 yards on a career-high 70.1% completion with 30 touchdowns! While some credit is deserved to his new Minnesota offensive line (which protected Cousins better than Washington did in terms of sacks), Cousins, by and large, carried this offense with his continual displays of [pinpoint accuracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSt04QipkAQ) and [unwavering leadership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdnLhzUKRYc). In summary, the Vikings got a career year out of Kirk Cousins. While it is hard to expect him to repeat such a performance as this year for the rest of his contract, it is safe to say that the Vikings are more than satisfied with being chained to Kirk Cousins.|
|8|Baker Mayfield|QB|No other player on this list can stake claim to what Baker Mayfield has done in the 2018. Dragging an entire franchise back into relevancy, back into the spotlight, back from the depths of the pit of misery. Baker fought against the worst head coach in the NFL for the first eight games of the season and still managed to almost double the Cleveland Browns win total from the last three seasons combined. He drug a roster from zero wins in the season previous to 7 a year later. That combined with having one of the best rookie seasons in recent memory is why he wakes up feeling dangerous.|
|7|Patrick Mahomes|QB|The 2018 MVP is a no-doubt lock for the top 10. Patrick Mahomes finished with a ridiculous 50 touchdowns to just 12 interceptions, maintaining both efficiency and high volume. He racked up 5,097 yards and 8.8 yards-per-attempt on his throws. With a better defense, we might be talking about even more achievements. For now we'll just say this isn't the last time he'll make the top 100.|/u/Super_Nerd92
|6|Matt Ryan|QB|Matt Ryan is another victim of elite QBs not getting the attention they deserve because people expect them to be amazing, and only notice them when they go far beyond even their normal greatness. Matt Ryan put up nearly identical stats to his 2016 MVP year (4924 yards instead of 4944, 35 TDs instead of 38 TDs, 7 INTs in both years, and a 69.4% completion instead of 69.9%). It's ridiculous that people don't think that he almost reached those same god level numbers, he was just hidden by guys like Brees and especially Mahomes who just had way better weapons. Not only did they have way better weapons (Matty Ice has Julio but he made Ridley and Sanu who they are, and helps the O-line succeed through his pre-snap intelligence), but he had to put up with Sarkisian, who actively tries to shit on his offense (while Brees and Mahomes had Payton and Reid). The fact that he got close to 2016 numbers with worse weapons (Freeman injury) and Sarkisian instead of Shanahan is nothing short of incredible, and why he without a doubt deserves the #6 spot on this list.|
|5|Jared Goff|QB|When he came into the league, Jared Goff took a ton of heat. He was too skinny, his hands too small. Labeled an airhead for not knowing which way the sun sets. Nobody thought he would succeed. Many thought he was a bust. Now, Goff is on pace for a different type of bust. The man who was once repeatedly picked on now is the one who picks apart defenses. When the game is on the line, he gives his best performances. He's an expert at dealing with pressure, such as [this example](https://gfycat.com/GracefulDeliciousKillifish) against the New Orleans Saints keeping the game alive in OT instead of taking a sack. A well deserved NFC Championship win for the man who carried his team there after the loss of Todd Gurley, and a well deserved top 10 appearance on this list.|
|4|Andrew Luck|QB|Luck's story is already well-known. In January 2017, he underwent surgery to his throwing shoulder with hopes of returning in time for the start of the 2017 regular season, but that date was eventually pushed back. Individually, Luck in 2018 was named to his fourth career Pro Bowl after starting all 16 games and completing 430-of-639 passes (67.3 percent) for 4,593 yards with 39 touchdowns and 15 interceptions for a 98.7 passer rating. He set single-season career highs in completions, attempts, completion percentage and passer rating. He ranked in the top-five in the NFL in passing touchdowns (second), attempts (second), completions (second) and yards (fifth).|
|3|Aaron Rodgers|QB|The GOAT has done it again, putting up elite numbers and solidifying his position in the MVP race early in the season. In the midst of a 4,442-25-2 year, he put up quality losses against many of the NFL’s best teams, single handedly saving the Packers from a 10-loss season while being dragged out of the playoffs by Mike McCarthy and Ron Zook. When it’s all said and done, however, this shouldn’t be a debate. The greatest quarterback of the modern era, and the greatest quarterback to ever play the game, put up magical numbers for one of his best seasons yet.(edited)|
|2|Russell Wilson|QB|The Seahawks have been trying to hold Russell Wilson down for years. They've tried Tom Cable, they've tried Brian Schottenheimer. Nothing has worked. Every year he breaks out of his cuffs and gets free, and this past year was no different. The modern day Houdini had one of his finest years yet in 2018, hooking up with Tyler Lockett and Doug Baldwin repeatedly downfield while breaking the ankles (and spirits) of every pass rusher that attempted to chase him. With 35 passing touchdowns to only 7 interceptions in 2018, he was aggressive with the football while avoiding costly turnovers, a rare and special combination. Wilson's success has led to new career paths for players like dynamite draft prospect Kyler Murray, who 10 years ago would not have had the option to play football at his size. Wilson might be a trailblazer, but it doesn't mean his success can be replicated. Very few QBs at any size can compete with his athleticism and accuracy, and it's what puts him at the #2 spot on this list.|
|1|Drew Brees|QB|Drew Brees was undoubtedly and undeniably the most special player in the NFL during the 2018 season. His 74.4% completion percentage and 38 TDs (paired with only 5 INTs) were remarkably impressive, resulting in a TD % of 6.5% and an INT % of only 1%. In addition to his TD/INT efficiency, he also led the league in passer rating, notching a 115.7 RTG. This is impressive for anyone, but you add in the fact that he's 40 years old and he only becomes more impressive. Finally, no QB in the NFL had a higher clutch percentage than Brees was in 2018. With 7 4th quarter comebacks and 6 game-winning drives (league leader in both), he showed that age isn't slowing him down in the late-game either. We are very pleased to present Brees with the illustrious honor of holding #1 in r/nfl Top 100!|
