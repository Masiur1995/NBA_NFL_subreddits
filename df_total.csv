This is source from Croatian media (one of many articles) - http://www.24sata.hr/news/trebala-je-dobiti-kemoterapiju-ali-ipak-cekamo-do-ponedjeljka-621897

She needs around 2.8 million $ and her parents sold everything they have, a lot of people in Croatia joined and they got around 1.4 million $ meaning they are at half. Problem is, they need to  collect that sum until Monday/Tuesday because if they don't, she'll have to take medication (chemo) and won't be eligible to travel to USA in 30 days. 
Other Croatians like Bojan Bogdanovic, Luka Modric, Ante Rebic, Ivan Rakitic, Ivano Balic also joined. 

Information about payment is on Saric's story with informations also. So if you can contribute, every single dollar or share on social media means something.

EDIT: Someone set up an online page where you can see how much money they got so far (although right now is not much for use because banks in Croatia don't work during weekend so we'll see real situation on Monday morning)

18,LeBron sits out final 6 games: A childhood dream denied.,222,452,0,nba,"I don't know what to say. I'm coming to the USA (from Australia) this coming Friday. To live out a childhood dream of seeing my favourite players play before they retire. I bought tickets to Dwyane Wade's final home game in Miami and Lakers v Jazz next weekend. This morning I was met with the news that LeBron has decided to sit out the final 6 games of the season to rest the groin Injury he sustained in late December. I'm not here to blast lebron or anyone, because I understand these are human beings, injuries happen and people need rest. I more if anything, wanted to question the reason why we play? Is it for yourself? For championships? For your city? For your legacy? Or for your fans? This is coming from a fan who is obviously very disappointed. Having flown a long way, spent alot of money and poured alot of time and emotion over the years into his fandom for this great sport and its stars. I only question LeBron and many nba stars. What about the fans? What may be just another game to you is a lifetime dream for us. I'm just dissapointed. 25 years lead up to this moment and a hero let's you down. I don't know if you'll see this lebron, but if you do, know why you play. Remember your fans. "

40,"Re: Kristaps Porzingis, no one knows anything and making any type of judgment is premature and harmful",74,103,0,nba,"I’ve seen a number of comments having made a conclusion one way or the other.  Literally all these comments are conjecture. Some things to keep in perspective:

1) Waiting a year to report a sexual assault is not unusual.

2) Any statement put out by anyone’s lawyer involved in this case is simply posturing in the court of public opinion.  None of these statements hold any water, as they are of ZERO substance to the legal and criminal outcomes.  There is no consequence to outright lying in public statements by attorneys. Only statements to a court or investigative bodies should hold any weight. Note that you can even lie to the public about what you said to an investigative body, as long as you didn’t lie to that body directly.

3) You can be a scumbag generally and not have raped someone. You can also be a nice person generally and have raped someone.  Likewise, you can be a terrible person and have been a sexual assault victim.  A person’s overall demeanor and personality certainly increases or decreases the likelihood something happened, but isn’t definitive.  

4) Circumstantial evidence and testimonial evidence are still evidence in court. 

5) No one knows what happened except for Kristaps and the accuser, and even then, they may have different recollections of what happened.  Although we rely on memory a whole lot during the legal process, it is famously unreliable and subject to manipulation, exaggeration, and sometimes outright mistake.

6) The criminal litigation process can influence but is not determinative of the civil process because the burden of proof is not the same. The criminal standard is “beyond a reasonable doubt” whereas the civil standard is “by a preponderance of the evidence,” which means there is a more than 50% chance something happened.  Remember, OJ Simpson was found not guilty in his criminal trial but was found liable in the civil trial.

7) On that note, in a criminal proceeding, one is NEVER “proven innocent.”  There is only “guilty” or “not guilty.” That means the jury has decided the evidence has proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, or the evidence hasn’t done that.  There is no finding on “innocence.”

The takeaway is everyone should stop playing the guessing game because you have no clue what happened and it’s only making everything worse."

These are the calls that were most disputed last night 

**KD's waived off potential 4 point play:**

Call on the floor was a PF. L2M report states that is a correct call with the following description: ""Bates-Diop (MIN) places two hands on Durant (GSW) and makes contact with him prior to the start of his upward shooting motion.""

Clip - https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0021801132&amp;eventNum=2229

**Okogie's inexplicable leg slap on Curry**

This foul was not called on the floor. L2M report states that it was a correct no call, with the description being ""Okogie (MIN) makes marginal ""hot-stove"" contact with Curry's (GSW) leg after the release of his jump shot attempt and does not affect his ability to land safely.""

Clip - https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0021801132&amp;eventNum=2226

**KD's foul on Towns with 0.5 left**

Call on the floor was a personal foul. L2M report states that it was a correct call, with the description being ""Durant (GSW) wraps Towns (MIN) around the waist and engages with him, restricting his FOM. The path of the throw-in has no bearing on the illegal action.""

Clip - https://official.nba.com/last-two-minute-report/?gameNo=0021801132&amp;eventNum=2231

**Incorrect no calls**

There were two incorrect no calls in the report:

1. Towns shooting foul on Durant, 1:51 remaining, with the description ""Towns (MIN) makes contact to the body of Durant (GSW) that affects his driving shot attempt.""

2. Durant personal foul on Towns, 1:11 remaining, with the description ""LLB shows Durant (GSW) makes contact to the body of Towns (MIN) during the drive that affects his SQBR.""


All of these are straight from the report, so take them as you will. Not a personal statement of any kind."

81,"Draymond passes wide open three, KAT knew it &amp; not impressed",364,3879,0,nba,
82,The only big man to average more points-per-minute than Joel Embiid this season is Wilt Chamberlain(who beat Embiid just twice),22,101,1,nba,"Translated into per-36 production, Embiid's 29.4ppg is the third best ever seen out of a big man. Only Wilt's 62 and 63 seasons of 50.4ppg(37.4ppg/36) and 44.8ppg(33.9ppg/36) surpass what Embiid has done in scoring. Embiid however has done so on far superior TS% at 59.7% to Wilt's 53.6%TS and 55%TS respectively. 

Not saying Embiid is better than those two years by any means as obviously you have to account for differences in era, and obviously Wilt's TS% will be lower when he's generating such a higher volume of points. 

Regardless, insanely impressive from a guy who just turned 25, has just 150 career games under his belt, little experience prior to the NBA, much more room to grow, and is playing in an era that has moved away from big men and the post on a roster really not constructed to help him lacking floor spacing and the presence of several other guys who need their touches and the ball. 

On a per-minute basis, Embiid is outscoring guys like Shaq, Kareem, many of Wilt's best years, etc. while being tied for 2nd in mpg among Centers this season."

84,"At the end of the first quarter, the Portland Trail Blazers lead the Detroit Pistons 14-11",19,71,0,nba,The Pistons somehow started the game 0-13 shooting and finished the quarter 3-21. The Blazers didn’t do much better shooting 7-27
85,The lack of help around Devin Booker is less the fault of his teammates and more the result of the incompetent front office,39,30,1,nba,"Hot take, I know.

2 rookies (Melton and Bridges) and Croatian legend Dragan Bender started the Grizzlies game with Booker and Ayton.  The other ballhandlers consisted of 39 year old Jamal Crawford (30 min played) and rookie Elie Okobo.  Rookie Ray Spalding and 2nd-year Josh Jackson were the only ""bigs"" available off the bench.  The only players who could be considered in their ""prime"" are Troy Daniels and Jimmer Fredette (who didn't play).

Their main rotation players, and 3 usual starters - TJ Warren, Kelly Oubre, Tyler Johnson, and Richuan Holmes were out with injury.  The front office has done pitiful job of putting depth on this team.  

Devin Booker still put up 48 points, 11 assists, and 3 boards on 66% shooting.  Deandre Ayton went down with an ankle injury in the middle of the 3rd quarter after posting 17/13.  The Grizzlies have a lot of scrubs themselves, but Conley and Valanciunas are bona fide NBA players.  Once Ayton went down, Bender couldn't hold down the paint by himself.

It's hard to blame all the rookies for not producing well, and you can't expect Bender to anchor a defense.  It's up to James Jones and crew to finally put a roster of NBA players together."

* They make KP available for trade

* Mavericks call and trade for him. Knicks don't disclose the accusation.

* Fast forward to now.

* KP is found guilty and imprisoned. He can't play for the Mavericks.

What options do the Mavericks have in this situation? They unknowingly traded for him without knowing about the accusation and now they've lost DSJ and Picks for a guy that won't play for them.

Would the league overturn the picks? What are the compensations for the Mavericks?"

- their eFG (efficient field goal %) this year

Previous leader was Klay Thompson with his *unreal* 10/11 performance earlier this year (01/21/19 against Los Angeles). Klay took 20 shots overall in that game, while Steph took 25 in this one. Neither player accrued a single free throw (shooting, intentional, or bonus). Definitely a statistical aberration given the volume and efficiency. 

Only two players have hit double-digit threes without a FTA now (Klay and Steph). The third-highest total is a four-way tie between Hield/Lopez/Green/Russell at 8 apiece. Despite the loss, just an unreal performance from Curry tonight. "

So we all know the Hornets beat the Raptors the other day on Jeremy Lamb’s half court shot. Many of you have probably seen Kemba’s reaction too - where he spins around in disgust and doesn’t even watch to see if his teammate’s shot goes in. And then he stands there in shock afterwards rather than chasing down Lamb in celebration. I get that lol, not really a big deal. 

But I was watching the Hornets vs Lakers highlights a few minutes ago and realized Kemba’s body language is relatively negative. He turned the ball over at half court with 4:13 left in the first half. The score was 50 - 53 Lakers at the time. He 100% quit on that defensive possession following the turnover. Rather than electing to play defense, he walked in the refs direction while the Lakers hustled down to complete the fast break. There are many other instances throughout the game where the Hornets give up a bucket and Kemba is looking around, seemingly for someone to blame. And maybe someone is to blame, but he’s not looking like someone I’d want to lead my team."

149,I'm the guy who asked about how you would rebuild the Grizzlies. Here is my plan.,23,13,0,nba,"Hi, Chris Wallace here. After hearing from r/nba and r/nbadiscussion about how I should rebuild the Grizzlies, I have written up a plan. If you have any questions, ask me in the comments below.

&amp;#x200B;

But seriously, here it is.

(Convey or Don’t Convey; It will not change these actions)

Free Agency

Resign JV, Tyler Dorsey, and Delon Wright

\- JV is a monster, Tyler Dorsey still has a lot of untapped potential, and Delon Wright can become a really good backup or starting PG

Let CJ Miles, Joakim Noah, and Justin Holiday walk

\- CJ Miles, Joakim Noah, and Justin Holiday are all over the age of 27, are not insanely good (sorry Noah - I would sign you if you request a cheap deal), and take up minutes from younger players such as Tyler Dorsey, Dillon Brooks, and Ivan Rabb

Sign Darren Collison

\- Gaining a veteran PG who will not take minutes away from a developing player and will help younger players such as JJJ and Bruno Caboclo with his passing and not taking too many shots

Pursue Terry Rozier, DLo, or Malcolm Brogdon

\- It is not the end of world if we don't get any of them (it's probably for the better) - I would only sign DLo on a large deal - this is just to show them we are interested

&amp;#x200B;

Trades

Mike Conley, Ivan Rabb, 2019 2nd Round Pick, and 2022 2nd Round Pick for Timofey Mozgov,  Jonathan Isaac, D.J. Augustin, and 2019 1st Round Pick- I'll start off by saying the Magic would only do this is they resign Vucevic and Terrence Ross. The Grizzlies get a young asset and a draft pick + 2 expiring contracts for Conley and Anderson. This would fully begin the Grizzlies rebuild and give the Magic a good PG while still keeping Fultz.

&amp;#x200B;

Draft

Draft or trade up to get Darius Garland, Jarret Culver, or Cam Reddish - get a SG, PG, or SF

\- Now you may be thinking, u/notfunnycontent why do you want another PG/SG when you'll have Darren Collison, Jevon Carter, and Delon Wright? We'll could trade one of them as well as other assets and draft picks to get higher up in the draft to go get these guys listed above or even shoot for the stars and try and get someone like Ja Morant or  R.J. Barrett.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly, I'm not Chris Wallace, but I do hope the Grizzlies do something along these lines.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit note: I have changed the Magic trade so it isn't as lopsided -- I do appreciate the constructive criticism though."

Absolutely remarkable display from Steph tonight... no free throws either. The last time he did this was effectively one month ago (2/21/19 - ten threes), and once more in January (eleven threes). A bizarre game all around, to be sure, but Steph was certainly a bright spot in this one. 

A side note! He's now hit 330 threes this season at a 43.4% clip, which puts him on pace to surpass 402 threes had he played the entire season. He's hit more threes than 2016-17 in seventeen fewer games. "

But if they're willing to trade me to help force that rebuild, then I am all for competing for championships and other things like that elsewhere.""

185,Do you think the Kings make the Playoffs next season?,19,3,0,nba,"Looking at the standings, I don’t know if they will. They’re quite a few games behind the 8th spot and next season pretty much all the top 8 will get better. 

Warriors may lose KD but they’ll still be a top 4 team without him. Nuggets will get more experience with there current unit. Rockets probably won’t change much so they’ll still be a top 4 team. Same for Blazers. Jazz will be able to develop Mitchell more, so I think they’ll still be in the 5-6 spot. Clippers can potentially add some big names to their already deep squad. The Spurs are the only ones I can see falling, but it’s hard to discount Pop. Thunder should still be there with the current squad. 

On top of that, Lakers could be in the mix if they make smart moves, and Mavs might be able to creep in if Porzingis is healthy/not in jail and they draft well.

Kings will get better next season, and they can add a big name to their roster, but I think next season will still be a fight to get in. "

225,Fun Fact: the 2020-2021 season will (very likely) be Lebron's first season not moving past any players on the All-Time scoring list.,10,69,0,nba,"With just a few games to go in the regular season, Lebron will end ~1000 points behind Kobe Bryant's 33,643 for 3rd on the NBA scoring ladder.  This means that if he plays a relatively healthy season next year without a massive drop in scoring, he will pass Kobe during the '19-'20 season and land roughly ~2200-2700 points behind Karl Malone's 36,930. Again, this is assuming that he has about a 2000 point season next year, which is possible but would require him to be active for nearly the whole season. For reference, he scored 2200 points in his final season in Cleveland, and just a touch under 2000 in the two previous. Even in this injury-plagued year, he will score around 1600 points in total, which will be his new career low.  

At hypothetically 2500ish points behind Malone in his 36-year-old season, it's all but impossible that he will pass him up in his 3rd Laker year, making it the only season in his career that he won't surpass somebody on the list.  However if he lands himself close enough to Malone that year, he could realistically pass Malone AND Kareem -- who is 1400 points ahead of Malone -- in the following season.  

This would still be incredibly difficult, since it would be asking him to put up 1800-2000 points for the next 3 seasons entering his mid-late 30s. It'll be interesting to see if he stays healthy enough, and should he actually pass KAJ, how far he runs up the ""score"" at the end of his career.  "

237,The Portland Trail Blazers are 9-1 in their last 10 games,26,162,0,nba,"Granted, most of their games were easy (5 teams sub .500), but considering that CJ McCollum has been injured for the last 6 games, and Nurkic for the last 2, and the average win margin is 8.2 points, it is still pretty impressive. Damian Lillard has been averaging 27/4.3/9.5 in this stretch on 46/41/94 shooting splits"
238,What would be the most entertaining conference finals matchups?,5,1,0,nba,"In my opinion it’d be

Makes you wonder what kinda scoring numbers he would put up without playing with ~~literally the two highest usage PG's ever~~ two of the highest usage PG's ever.

Also his career high is only 54 points. You would think it would be higher, but that's it."

“I’m sure you saw that clip the other day where he is telling a fan ‘I’m going for 50’ and that goes viral. How about go for a win? How about go for one stop at any point of your career? How about try and do that? How about tell a fan you’re going to lock down on defense and try and hold a team under 120 points?”

 EDIT:

I threw this up cause it made me laugh at my desk this morning. Lighten up in the comments. 

This was part of a 25 minute discussion where the overall point was that Golliver wished both Booker and the Suns would put energy towards a winning culture. Obviously, they talked about the lack of help Booker has in that endeavor. I highly recommend listening to the entire discussion and subscribing to SI Open Floor Podcast. "
242,Warriors National TV Schedule Records (since 2012),4,30,0,nba,"The Warriors have been a fixture on national TV ever since their first championship in 2015. How good have they performed on the national stage since then? I'm including games starting from the 2012-13 season since that's when they started getting good. Playoffs are not included because they're all national TV games. I'm not including NBA TV games. Please note that the records may be off by a few games since some games got moved to a national TV slot later and others got removed.

Overall: 108-46 (.701)

ESPN (ABC): 15-7 (.681)

ESPN (other): 50-18 (.735)

ESPN (total): 65-25 (.722)

TNT: 43-21 (.671)

Home: 64-25 (.719)

Away: 45-21 (.681)

Generally, national TV games pit a team against better opponents, so for the Warriors to maintain above a 70% win percentage in national TV games is actually quite insane especially since they rank at the top (or near the top) of national TV appearances per season. Also keep in mind that I included the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons.

A few things that are interesting to note:

* The only team the Warriors haven't played on national TV since the start of the 2012-13 season are the Magic. Small market team and they suck. Makes sense.
* On the road, since the start of the 2012-13 season, the Warriors have not played on national TV at Talking Stick Resort Arena, American Airlines Center, American Airlines Arena, Bankers Life Fieldhouse, Amway Center, State Farm Arena, and Barclay's Center.
* At home, since the start of the 2012-13 season, the Warriors have not played on national TV against the Kings, Jazz (not 100% sure about this, and Hornets (regular season only).
* A 15-7 record on ABC is particularly awesome because these are the cream of the crop matches (well, at least they're supposed to be, thanks ESPN for your Lakers/Knicks biases)
* For some reason, all 3 of the Warriors appearances on TNT Players Only have been against the Thunder, but correct me if I'm wrong (that's actually wrong, the Warriors made an appearance against the Jazz at home this year)
* Despite all of these win percentages being well above average, the Warriors still have a higher winning percentage when not in front of an audience. That is to be expected."

248,Can we finally let “Empty Stats” die?,29,2,0,nba,"Booker has been playing great. He hasn’t actually been winning but the support he’s been getting is great. Basically he’s playing great and it’s not fair to put him down because he team isn’t good.

Demarcus Cousins has put up good stats for many years now. He was always been called for producing empty stats because his team sucked and they wouldn’t win. Very similar to Booker.

Is it finally time to admit they are both and we’re good players while their teams were bad? And also that they DID NOT produce empty stats?"
249,Is Josh Jackson a bust?,34,0,0,nba,"I don’t even know is there a particular thing that he does well as a wing player. Scoring at an Andrew Wiggins level 48% TS , averages a pedestrian 6 rebounds and 3 assists with 3.4 TOV per 36, maybe he is an okay defender I am not sure, but apparently the Suns don’t play much defense anyways. And he literally regressed from his rookie season. I just don’t see him getting to a normal starter level... and his pick was as valuable as PG13 in 2017."

* elite rim protector, he has 3rd best DIFF% in the whole NBA equal -13.3% while defending at the rim(min 200 FGA). Oppo players are shooting only 49.4% against him at &lt;6ft
* his OFF/DEF RTG's in the 4Q are 107/100.8 +6.2(2nd best among Grizzlies players, only behind Bradley). In the past according to Casey he was unplayable in the 4Q
* he nearly doubled his AST%, looks better at playmaking, reading the game and passing out of the double teams. Passing was another weak point of his. He is still average at this, so there is a room for further improvement.
* he is averaging career highs in PTS, REB, AST, BLK, FTA, USG% and many other advanced categories. 20/10 player in under 30min.

The beast was unleashed. Grizzlies got damn good player, who is only 26 and still has  a lot of room for further improvement. Albeit he has a player option after this season, but so far he looks very happy in Memphis."

267,"3 more made FG, 18% better 3PT%, 10 more ORB, 9 more assists for the Kings in their loss to the Rockets tonight",7,0,0,nba,"Kings also had one more DREB and four blocks to Houston's 2. Rockets had 3 more steals (3 vs 6) and three fewer turnovers (12 v 9), along with an overall 2.3% better shooting percentage. The Rockets also attempted 12 more free throws, (15 vs 27) and hit 15 more (9 vs 24).

I thought this was a really interesting game, as I do a lot of Rockets games that I watch- Harden is an incredible talent to the point where it feels like he can just completely overcome a team even on a good night for them. However, I do feel like this game to me felt less fun to watch than I'd expect from a 50 point triple double- I think I and a lot of others might expect the better passing, 3pt shooting, and rebounding team to take any given game. The opposite being true- especially with Harden shooting more FTs than the entire Kings team, I think can definitely fuel people's being upset about Harden and MDA's success.

Thoughts?

290,Celtics commentators,79,51,0,nba,"I get a lot of you don’t like the Celtics so Celtics “homers” are probably the last two people you want to listen commentate a basketball game, but I just want to share some background on the duo of Mike Gorman and Tommy Heinsohn. 

#Gorman

Gorman was born in Dorchester Massachusetts in 1945. He joined the air force for 5 years from 1970-1975. 

He became the play-by-play commentator for the team in 1981. He has a tremendous resume in broadcasting including playoffs on TBS, olympics, college basketball and more, all on top of his tenure with the Celtics. 


#Heinsohn

This is really why I made this post. This guy is an absolute legend of the game of basketball. He has been associated with the Celtics since the 1950’s, when he was drafted in 1956. He won rookie of the year that year. He retired as a player in 1965, and in those 9 years won 8 NBA titles. He also was a 6x all star. He also played an instrumental role in the progression of the league. After Cousy, Tommy became the second president of the NBPA. As president he led a strike among the all-stars which led to the NBA’s acceptance of free agency, one of the best times of the year for NBA fans. 

After he retired as a player he became a play-by-play guy for 3 years at the request of Red Auerbach. He then became coach in 1969 and coached until 1978. In this time he won 1 coach of the year award, 2 NBA titles, and coached the team to a total record of 427-263. 

Tommy was inducted into the Hall of Fame separately as a player and coach. One of four players to hold such an honor. 

He returned to broadcasting in 1981 joining Gorman as a duo. They have been the guys to commentate Celtics games since, and they’re now approaching 40 years. However, as Tommy is aging he has been replaced for road games by Brian Scalabrine. As a player, coach and broadcaster, Tommy has been a part of 17 NBA titles. 17! That’s every title for the team with more titles than any team in the leagues history. 


I feel like too many people don’t know about Tommy and what he’s done for the team and why he means so much to fans. Our grandparents don’t know the Celtics without Tommy, almost NOBODY knows the Celtics without Tommy. In many ways he is the Celtics and has been so instrumental not only in the teams history but in the leagues history. Mike is also a long time member of the Celtics family, and is a well respected and successful commentator in his own right. 

So, feel free to say whatever about Mike and Tommy, but at least understand what they mean to Celtics fans, particularly Tommy (no offense to Mike).

302,Is the NBA salary cap obsolete?,8,1,0,nba,"I read the following article on the nba website talking about the NBA in the seventies and competition:

https://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/decade_of_parity.html

It talks about how with less teams and more talent there was a lot more competition in the league. The following comment stood out to me from Doug Collins:

“In the 1970s teams were not constrained by salary caps when they were considering trades for that final piece of the puzzle,” said current NBA broadcaster Doug Collins, a four-time All-Star who played some of his best basketball in the 1976-77 playoffs when his Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Blazers in the NBA Finals. “They could make the trade to get that one player to push them over the top. The league, as a whole, was much stronger and more competitive and I don’t know if we will ever have that type of parity again.”

These days we have fancy cap rules, we have changes to draft lottery odds which aren’t going to bring any type of parity because it’s now more of a crapshoot.

And yet we now find players who have to accept more volatile contracts (one year deals) because teams need to consider cap space and flexibility, and manage this cap situation.

Now everyone I’ve talked to says if the salary cap was removed, all the rich teams would dominate, but that doesn’t seem to have happened in the 70s.

I’m not saying to remove the restricted free agency rules, rookie scale rules or contract length (4 vs 5 years) rule. Nor to remove the luxury tax rules (they are important to keen rich teams to account) but I think removing a cap, and scrapping the draft lottery so that it’s just straight based on record, would be a good solution.

What could this lead to? Well players may get better deals, more stability, and teams could trade for pieces they really need when they just need that extra body to get them over the line. The teams will still need to pay luxury taxes to other teams, so that allows the smaller teams to still grow, there is also the tv deal that benefits all teams.

I’d like to get some thoughts about what others think."
303,"30-year-old Kevin Love's four-year, $120 million extension starts next year. Can the Cavs trade him?",132,123,0,nba,"Love is injury prone, his two-point shooting is awful, his three-point shooting is merely around the league average, and his offensive rebounding, blocks, and steals are the lowest of his career.  But today I was reminded that his new four-year max contract hasn't even started yet!

The silver lining for the Cavs this season is that Love has not single-handedly moved the Cavs ahead of the Bulls in the lottery odds, which wouldn't be hard to do if he was still a star, especially since the Bulls have placed all their best players on their injured list.  The cloud, though, is that he might continue to play this way for another *four years* while being paid the max.

There was a lot of speculation at the beginning of the year that the Cavs might trade Love, but would anyone want him at that price?  Would you want your team to trade for him?  I know he's not right for the Bulls."

In fact, it feels like that’s the predominant form of offense nowadays isn’t it? Get a scoring ball handling PG or wing who can run a pick and roll/pick and pop and have a bunch of shooters waiting for a pass for a three. 

Is there anything revolutionary anymore in coaching? If it’s all the same, what are coaches doing that makes them different ? Or is just the talent they have that makes the difference, not the coaching?"

I realize Durant has had the better finals performances the past couple of years, but overall Steph has had the more significant impact on the Warriors offense as has been documented in recent years(their record with him vs without him), and edges out Durant on the majority of advanced stats.

331,Fouling while up 3,26,4,0,nba,"Inspired by the GSW vs MIN game today, I wanna bring up an issue that has bugged me for a long time

When a team is down 3 with little time left, they usually want to take a 3 to tie the game. But the defending team can just foul them to force them to shoot free throws and never close the lead

So there are 2 issues to this

- Why don’t all teams start doing this? If all the teams do this, there would never have been any “3 point shots to tie to game” shots in the NBA right? One example is the Spurs vs Heat 2013 Game 6, if Spurs just fouled Lebron he would have had 1 less ring lmao

Which also leads to the bigger issue
- Why the fxxk is this even a thing? I want to see the team down 3 attempting the 3 pointer with anticipation of the shot going in/rebound if it doesn’t, and from the same example, allowing Ray Allen’s shot to be possible. This strategy is counter competitive, and is no fun to watch at all lmao

What do you guys think?"

I'm searching for a Stats source for Player Minutes Averages based on how many Rest the Team had.

Thx in Advance!"
333,"Who would you pick to start your team with, Harden or Giannis?",43,0,0,nba,"There's clearly benefits to both and they both bring different things to the table, with the MVP discussion being so heated I want to look at it in a different light. Who do you think would be the best player to start a team with?
Personally I'd take Giannis (not taking anything away from Harden he is f***ing crazy good) simply because he is young and has so much room to grow still and I think you could fit him into any type of system and he'd perform well. "

335,How The Denver Nuggets Built an Elite Team With Other Teams Draft Picks,7,50,0,nba,
336,[OC] What would be the 3 Man Wrestling Stable for every NBA Team,18,31,0,nba,"**Golden State Warriors - Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green**

They are the New Day of the bunch. They have won multiple titles together, pulled off records together, and are all eccentric personalities. Draymond Green is a meaner Big E Langston, though just as funny on the mic. Nobody wants the three to break up, even knowing the fact they would all find success individually. Big E is more primed for a solo run than Draymond.

**Denver Nuggets - Nikola Jokic, Mason Plumlee, Will Barton (Isaiah Thomas manager)**

Denver has two of the best playmaking big men in the entire league. It would be dumb not to pair these two seven foot white boys with Will the Thrill Barton. You can either go double big men or have versatility with Barton and a big man. If Barton were to go down, Isaiah Thomas at 5'9 to counterbalance the two seven footers would be amazing. 

**Houston Rockets - James Harden, Gerald Green, Austin Rivers** 

Originally the team was supposed to be Harden flanked by enforcers Clint Capela and PJ Tucker. Instead, we went in a different direction. Harden is a connoisseur of strip clubs so his faction will be focused on cash money. Gerald Green and Austin Rivers embody the irrational confidence of their team and are there to take the pin for Harden when need be. 


**Portland Trailblazers - Damian Lillard, CJ Mccollum, Evan Turner**

Easily the most fun team on the mic. Dame can create the song for their entrance, CJ can run their social media, and ET would be the funniest person on the mic in the league. Evan Turner has a master list of amazing quotes, imagine how many more he would have if he was a star? 
Would this team win a lot of matches? No. However, they would be over as hell and sell tons of merch. I feel bad for Enes Kanter who wants a career in the WWE. At least he is smashing Dana Brooke.


**Los Angeles Clippers - Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Lou Williams**

I have a running theory that Patrick Beverley and Montrezl Harrell fist fight before games to get hyped up. This tag team reminds me of the Usos. Consistently underrated guys who can get dirty and do whatever it takes to win. 
I think this trio would actually be more intimidating as wrestlers than NBA players. 


**Utah Jazz - Rudy Gobert, Donovan Mitchell, Jae Crowder**

Mitchell is the obvious breakout solo star of this faction. Mitchell has long arms, agility, has aerial explosiveness and is charismatic as hell. I can imagine him pulling off some sick tag team moves with Gobert where they make full use of Gobert's 9'10 standing vertical. 
Jae Crowder is there to take pins. 

**Oklahoma City Thunder - Russell Westbrook, Dennis Schroder, Steven Adams**

Paul George is the best player on the Thunder and is one of the five best players in the NBA this season. However, for the Thunder wrestling faction, you need the swagger and irrational confidence of Westbrook and Schroder. Schroder has crazy hair-dos and drives golden cars without anyone asking, put him in a wrestling ring and he'll pull off some magic. Steven Adams as a Dothraki warrior is the heavy of the faction for obvious reasons. 

**San Antonio Spurs - DeMar DeRozan, Rudy Gay, Marco Belinelli**
 
We are going to call this trio the forgotten sons. The whole storyline is built around DeMar DeRozan who feels sad and lost after being dumped by Toronto. Unfortunately, the Spurs are the least charismatic team in the league and make for a poor wrestling faction. 

**Sacramento Kings - De'Aaron Fox, Buddy Hield, Bogdan Bogdanovic**
 
One of my favorite trios to watch on an NBA court together. Would they be good in a ring together? Hield and Bogi I'm not sure, however, it's a guarantee Fox will be pulling out some Dragon Ball Z type shit in the ring. 

**Los Angeles Lakers - LeBron James, Kyle Kuzma, Lonzo Ball** 

Lonzo and Kuzma will be swagged out in King entire and then be there to take the pin for him when he refused to tag back in.
 

**Minnesota Timberwolves - Karl Anthony-Towns, Derrick Rose, Andrew Wiggins**

This will be a fun team. KAT as the young superstar with the potential to become a solo champion. Rose at the former MVP who has now found glory after many injuries to become a rocking tag team competitor. And Andrew Wiggins to be the third who takes the pins. 
New Orleans Pelicans - Anthony Davis, Kenrich Williams, Frank Jackson
You sell tickets by putting Davis's name on the card, then put the other two in the match and get squashed in under a minute. 

**Memphis Grizzlies - Mike Conley, Jaren Jackson, Chandler Parsons**
 
Three guys who all seem nice but don't make sense together. Kinda reminds me of Rusev-Nakamura currently or Ziggler and Big E from the past. Conley at this point is a Jeff Hardy, simply a gatekeeper ready to take some pins and maybe get a two-week stint with the US title. 

**Dallas Mavericks - Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber, Dwight Powell (Dirk as manager)**

You put Luka Doncic with the two players on the Mavericks who dunk. You're gonna have a fun time watching them take pins and knowing Luka is gonna be main eventing Wrestlemania one day.

**Phoenix Suns - Devin Booker, Dragan Bender, Troy Daniels** 
Devin Booker is going to be like Jason Jordan before he found Chad Gable. Lost with an endless stream of bad tag team partners who will keep him from achieving success. 

**Milwaukee Bucks - Giannis Antetokoumpo, Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe**

Three long and athletic freaks together on one them. Phew, this team would rock the house down. Your only fear is an erratic Eric Bledsoe pulls a heel turn at a random moment. 

**Toronto Raptors - Kyle Lowry, Kawhi Leonard, Pascal Siakam**
 
Could you imagine taking a spear from Pascal Siakam running at you? Could you imagine Kawhi Leonard reaching at you from half a ring away and grabbing you with his massive hand just to choke slam you? Imagine Kyle Lowry being a general menace to your day? This Raptors faction is the biggest threat to the Bucks in the East. 

**Philadelphia 76ers - Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons, Jimmy Butler**

I kept going back and forth between whether or not to put Jimmy Butler in the trio or to put TJ McConnell in. As scrappy and enjoyable TJ is, I cannot leave Butler of this list. Jimmy Butler is the veteran leader of this faction and will 100% turn heel on his boys for his own ego. 
Bobi, Tobi, and Mike Scott not being a faction also sadden me greatly. 

**Indiana Pacers - Bojan Bogdanovic, Myles Turner, and Domantas Sabonis**

This tag team would be a carbon copy of the Denver tag team except the two big men are great athletes. Bogdanovic fills in for an injured Victor Oladipo, just like in real life. 

**Boston Celtics - Kyrie Irving, Jayson Tatum, Marcus Smart**
 
I believe Kryie will wrestle as Uncle Drew. The other two will follow suit and create their own characters with make-up and prosthetics. Legendary in small doses, awfully disappointing as a full feature. 

**Detroit Pistons - Blake Griffin, Andre Drummond, Reggie Jackson**

Every time Blake Griffin goes for a big flip or takes a massive bump, fans will live in terror of him tearing something and we lose Blake for 4–8 months. Andre Drummond as the former all-star who is now resided into tag team work, and a disappointing Reggie Jackson who is here to take the pins in tag team action. 

**Brooklyn Nets - D'Angelo Russell, Spence Dinwiddie, Ed Davis**
 
Russell and Dinwiddie have perfect wrestler names. The duo has run the fast-paced Nets offense at a high level this season and might just get them to the playoffs. Jarrett Allen seems like the pick for this team as the big guy. That's a trap. Allen is fun and athletic, but Davis can get super physical and can still accomplish big feats of athleticism. Imagine Boss Davis suplexing you hard into the mat while Dinwiddie drops an elbow into you from the top rope. 

**Orlando Magic - Jonathan Isaac, Aaron Gordon, Terrence Ross**
 
This faction will be three babyfaces built around the religious figure and Jesus lover Jonathan Isaac. The uber-athleticism of this trio will make them must-watch television. There is some Hardy Boys type fear where they will try a crazy flip or move as a finisher, only to get side-stepped or take knees to the ribs. 

**Charlotte Hornets - Kemba Walker, Cody Zeller, Malik Monk**

Kemba will be happy when Cody Zeller is healthy. unfortunately, he will take months off at a time due to injury. When Zeller isn't healthy, he'll be sad watching Monk go from hitting one great to botching another. 

**Washington Wizards - Bradley Beal, Thomas Bryant, Dwight Howard**
 
I feel everyone forgot Dwight Howard is on the Wizards roster. We are putting him in this trio to sell tickets. People hate Dwight Howard so he can work as a heel. Eh, nevermind. Even with a superstar like Bradley Beal, it's difficult to find any joy in the Wizards.
Did anyone watch the game where Thomas Bryant mauled Luc Mbah A Moute's arm during a late regular season game against the Rockets in 2018? He drastically changed the NBA season and Luc's career. I wonder what he would do in a wrestling ring. 

**Atlanta Hawks - Trae Young, John Collins, Kevin Huerter**

The funniest team on the card. Too young to know what they are doing together, yet will bring joy to our hearts as they figure it out. 

**Chicago Bulls - Zach LaVine, Otto Porter, Lauri Markannen** 

All talented and young, except disappointing us by their lack of cohesion. Essentially the Nega Hawks.

**Cleveland Cavaliers - Kevin Love, Collin Sexton, Cedi Osman** 

If Kevin Love gets injured then they get written off TV completely. 

**New York Knicks - Mitchell Robinson, Emmanuel Mudiay, Mario Hezonja**
 
They are spending most of their time at the NXT performance center.




Edit:

I left off the Miami Heat. They would obviously be Bam Adebayo, Dwyane Wade, and Dion Waiters. Big Bam would be the star.

337,Three questions with the Hawks' legendary organist they hired from Craigslist,2,16,0,nba,
338,"The Lakers severely not meeting expectations this year, which legacy will be hurt more by this failure, the Lakers or Lebron?",115,0,0,nba,"- Lebron has made the Finals 8 straight years with the Cavs &amp; Heat but with the Lakers they can’t even make the playoffs and the team has had 5 different head coaches in 10 years. 

- Lebron has been made a legend by how dominant he has been with taking teams from the lottery (Cleveland) or mediocrity (Miami) to the highest levels but he couldn’t even make the playoffs in the West. This year has validated his critics who use the East as the easy conference excuse for him. 


Does the fact that this team couldn’t make the playoffs make the Lakers look incompetent to succeed over 7 other Western Conference teams OR does it reflect how Lebron’s dominance was overstated?"
339,Who are the DPOY Contenders?,40,45,0,nba,"This year has had an incredible MVP race (and developed into a great ROY race too), but it seems like DPOY has been kind of forgotten. Giannis leads most defensive metrics, Paul George generated a lot of buzz before the Thunder's recent slide, Gobert is being Gobert. Who's your winner? "

343,"Why is there this assumption the Lakers absolutely need a a Kawhi or Durant level star to compete? The top teams in the West like Denver have one legit allstar. If the Lakers can get 3, 4 or 5 good players for that max money I think they'll be fine.",67,1,0,nba,"Guys like Nurkic could be had for cheap and then you have guys like Middleton, Danny Green, Vuevic, Brook Lopez, Mirotic, etc that can be three and D shooters. Not to mention they can package Ball and Ingram and get at the very least some value back.  I think if they strike out on free agents they have some options but they'll have to be creative with how to build the roster. "
344,How would you rebuild the Grizzlies?,69,10,0,nba,"As a Grizzlies fan, I'm curious to hear your takes on what you would do with the Grizzlies.

Couple Things to Take Note of

 \- They are trying to get out of the bottom 8 for the draft so their pick can convey to Boston; if it did not, it would be top 6 protected next year, and unprotected the year after

 \- Most everything is uncertain besides Jaren Jackson as nearly half the team enters into Free Agency this year

354,"LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, and Stephen Curry absolutely dominated the 2016-17 NBA playoffs.",171,415,0,nba,"Took a look back at the stats, and holy shit. These guys were straight up otherworldly. Like, they were playing on a different level. I hope I didn't come off as click-baity in the title, because this domination is true.

 *Entire playoff stats:*

 ***Kevin Durant:*** 29/8/4 on **56**/**44**/89 shooting - 68% TS (Champion, FMVP)

 ***LeBron James:*** 33/9/8 on **57**/**41**/70 shooting - 65% TS

 ***Stephen Curry:*** 28/6/7 on 48/**42**/**90** shooting - 66% TS (Champion)

 ***Kawhi Leonard:*** 28/8/5 on **53**/**46**/**93** shooting - 67% TS
 
 Probably an irrelevant post right now, but god damn, these stats are incredible. Sometimes, I think we take for granted the talent that we have the privilege of seeing each year. At least while it's happening. I wasn't as enamored back then while watching the games, but looking back at it, this is the pinnacle of basketball ability.

###Near Misses

This section is dedicated to players who didn't have a Club 60 performance during the week but came very close. (Players with Club 60s during the week, wont be highlighted here barring an unusual circumstance)

We start the weeks Near Misses with a very somber 59 from **Nurk** in POR W over BRK.  **Nurk** already had a Club 60 on the season and almost got his second putting up (32 - 16 - 5 - 2 - 4).  **Nurk** almost has the most non-points in any games this season with 40 during his Club 60.  Get well soon **Nurk**!

**Kemba** who also has a Club 60 on the year registered two near misses this week with a 58 in CHA W over BOS (36 - 11 - 9 - 2 - 0) and followed it up 3 days later with a 59 in CHA W over SAS (38 - 9 - 11 - 0 - 1).  He had exactly 20 TRB + AST in both games.

Rounding out our near misses for the week we have **D'lo** who followed up his first Club 60 of the year last week with a 57 in BRK L @ POR (39 - 9 - 8 - 1 - 0).

I think it is getting very close to calling Club 70s and 80s **""Club Harden""**.  With his 72 in HOU W over SAS (61 - 7 - 1 - 3 - 0) **Harden** now has 10 Club 70s.  To give this some perspective **Giannis** is second in Club 60s with 10.

**LaMarcus** recorded his second Club 60 of the season in SAS W over BOS putting up a 68 (48 - 13 - 6 - 0 - 1).

**Booker** joins Club 60 in style with two Club 60s on the week.  **Book** started with a 68 in PHO L @ UTA (59 - 4 - 4 - 1 - 0) followed up by a 66 in PHO L to WAS (50 - 10 - 4 - 1 - 1).  He joins **Russ** and **Beal** as the only players with multiple Club 60s and a losing record.

**Embiid** just put up the fastest Club 60 on the year by almost a full 2 minutes.  **Embiid** put up a 62 in 27mins 47secs in PHI W over BRK (39 - 13 - 6 - 3 - 1).  That is the third Club 60 on the year under 30 minutes (**Harden** 29mins 34secs and **Giannis** 29mins 39secs)

**KAT** has moved into third with his 9th Club 60 on the season with a 61 in MIN W over MEM.  (33 - 23 - 3 - 1 - 1).

**JaVale McGee** joined Club 60 with exactly a 60 in LAL L to BRK (33 - 20 - 0 - 1 - 6).  It is the first Club 60 this year with 0 AST.

**BRK** gave up 2 Club 60s this week and went 1 - 1.  They now join **TOR** at 4 - 2 when allowing a Club 60.  They are tied for 3rd in allowing Club 60s yet they have a 66% win percentage when allowing a Club 60.  Very interesting.

**UTA** gave up another Club 60 in their W over PHO. **UTA** has the second ranked defense in the NBA yet has given up the most Club 60s with 8. ( https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2019.html#misc_stats::11)

**UTA** is also the only team to allow 2 Club 60s in a single game (hence their 8 allowed yet 2 - 5 record). 

**MEM** gave up their first Club 60 to someone other than **Harden** (4th on the season)

**BOS** surrendered their second Club 60 in as many weeks after not having on all year.

**MIN** and **DEN** are still the only teams to not allow a Club 60.  Can they make it?

###Notes

Just a quick reminder of what this series of posts are about:

""The wild numbers this season got me thinking, what would classify as ""video game"" numbers. Numbers that just do not make sense outside of a video game.

Bill Simmons had the 42 club in the Book of Basketball. But the 42 club is about averages (and only includes points, rebounds, assists), while ""video game"" numbers would be only about a single game.

I wanted to include steals and blocks into the formula (because they should matter) and I wanted it to be something extremely difficult to achieve. Again it should make you questions ""are these 2k numbers?!""

in 2009 playoffs LeBron had a 51.7 average (points, rebounds, assists) so i felt it needed to be higher than that.

I settled on 60. If you can put up over 60 between points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks....then (imo) those are legit video game numbers.""

We all know about the Tatum ""he's only 19"" jokes, but even he turned 20 halfway into his rookie year


Zion will be 19 his entire rookie season. He is already a monster and is so young. "

373,No stars will sign with the Lakers in the off season,23,0,0,nba,"I bet that no stars will sign with the Lakers during the offseason. This is because all of the future free agents saw how bad a shit show it was with LeBron this past season.

I am so sure about this that I am willing to eat any article of clothing that the Reddit seems necessary and record it. Mark my words, I won’t need to do it though."
374,Who would you rather have on a team? Prime melo or Prime Tmac,32,17,0,nba,"I'm gonna have to go with tmac. I feel like he is more versatile on offense because of his off-ball movement and strong ability to read &amp; react to screens and pindowns. Not the best defender, but better defense than melo. Melo is real nice when he has someone else running the offense for him and doesn't need the ball in his hands, but we only saw that the year he was with chauncey billups. 

What do you guys think? "

Can we finagle the positions a little to get KAT and Gobert on the All-NBA 3rd team? People have been saying LaMarcus is the next most worthy forward but he's logged most of his minutes at center anyways.

392,Jordan &amp; Barkley,10,6,0,nba,What’s going on with these two. They used to be good friends now there’s some sort of beef around them. What’s the real story?
393,Why does Embiid struggle against Marc Gasol?,37,16,0,nba,"So I've been going over some matchups and I'm surprised to see Embiid struggling alot in matchups against Gasol. 

In 5 matchups, Embiid has never scored over 15 on Gasol and his efficiency is below average and bad for his standards. Here are their stats against each other:


**Gasol:** 16p/3a/6r/1blk/1.4stl on 37/45/80 (3W)

**Embiid:** 14p/3a/12r/1blk/0.8stl on 31/6/73 (2W)


Why does Embiid seem to struggle with Gasol? Is Gasol just a bad matchup for Embiid or was the Memphis defense set up to defend Embiid?"
394,"Kevin Durant through January 15: 55 2P%, 37 3P%, 63 TS%. Durant since January 15: 63 2P%, 30 3P%, 62.3 TS%",10,29,0,nba,"Durant's first half nearly matched his career averages of 53% on 2PA and 38% on 3PA. While Durant's 3P shooting has collapsed in the second half of the season, he's maintained his excellent TS% by making 2Pers at the same rate as Giannis. He's shooting a ridiculous 59% from midrange and 64% from 15-19 feet (51 of 80) since January 15.

Among the 33 players averaging 20+ PPG for the season, Durant has the third best TS% behind Giannis and Curry."
395,"Goran Dragić and Luka Dončić face each other tonight for the first time ever. As they are two of Slovenia’s best ever players, 2000 Slovenes travelled to Miami to see the game live. An average fan is likely to spend between 600-800$ just to see this spectacle.",316,3751,0,nba,"Mind that the average monthly salary in Slovenia is around 1000€. 

Slovenes are known for their strong love and dedication for any sport in which their fellow Slovenes prosper. So we should probably expect loud cheering for any basket those two guys score. 
"
396,"Well after the game has ended, Luka Doncic comes back onto the court to thank all the Slovenian fans in attendance",30,474,1,nba,
397,Found probably the first picture of Jusuf Nurkic in a basketball jersey,16,103,0,nba,
398,Mitchell Robinson tonight vs Raptors: 19pts/21reb/2blk/1stl on 8/12 shooting,126,553,0,nba,"Knicks got an absolute steal with him at the 36 in the 2nd rd. Major athleticism and hops. If he figures out fundamentals and gets a quality point guard, he could be nasty.

Also missed two free throws with 3 seconds left missing out on the 20/20"
399,"[Lowe] Ten things I like and don't like, including the ragtag Grizzlies",20,64,1,nba,
400,Which recent players (from the last 10 years) were legendary in college but couldn't find success in the NBA?,35,11,0,nba,I'm talking about guys like Jimmer Freddette and Tyler Hansborough. The kind of guys that are revered for their college performances but shit the bed in the NBA.
401,The Milwaukee Bucks are 2 wins (in 6 games) away from clinching the #1 Seed Overall!,62,118,0,nba,"As of today, the Milwaukee Bucks have an impressive record of 57-19. The next best record is also in the East, where the Toronto Raptors holds an impressive 53-23 win-loss ratio.

By the way, the #1 Seed in the West is already out of this race to the top (the Golden State Warriors has a 51-23 record).

Thus, if the Bucks goes 2-4 in the last 6 games and the Raptors goes 6-0, both teams would finish with a 59-23 w/l, which means a tie-breaker would decide who gets to be the first seed in the East (and, consequently, the #1 overall in this scenario).

So, if both these teams finish 59-23, one of them would have to not lead their local divisions to be tossed to the second place. But, since both teams are guaranteed to be leaders in their divisions (Eastern Atlantic and Central), Bucks would end up with the #1 seed, because in their head-to-head against the Raptors they stand 2-1, with no remaining games to be played between the teams.

__TL;DR__: Even if the Bucks go 2-4 and the Raptors go 6-0, the Bucks would still grab #1 seed in the East and overall, because they won more games in their h2h clashes during the season and both lead their respective regional divisions.

EDIT: Even if GSW go 8-0, the Bucks would own the tie-breaker because of their record within their own division."
402,Why are foreign players so likeable?,93,0,0,nba,"It seems like simply having a non-American accent makes a player 2x more likeable, from a fan's standpoint.


Is there a psychological or metaphysical reason for this? "
403,Why don't advanced stats like Joel Embiid?,117,31,0,nba,"Even though Embiid is almost unanimously considered a top 2 center in the league advanced stats seem to rate him below quite a few of his peers. For example here are Embiid's advanced stats verses other top centers:

|Player|PER|BPM|WS/48|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Embiid|26.1|3.9|0.198|
|Jokic|26.6|9.6|0.232|
|Towns|27.0|7.3|0.211|
|Vucevic|25.7|6.7|0.196|
|Gobert|24.8|7.1|0.271|

He's unanimously rated below Jokic and KAT while Gobert destroys him in BPM and WS/48 and even Vucevic is rated as slightly better overall. Embiid's BPM especially is poor compared to the rest. Does anyone know why this is? He puts up plenty of points, rebounds, stocks and a decent amount of assists for a center on good efficiency. The only cause that I can think of is his high turnover numbers but Jokic and KAT don't average significantly less (though of course Jokic averages way more assists). Seems weird given that both the eye test and regular stats suggest he is better than this."
404,Buddy Hield said few weeks ago that Kings will for sure make the playoffs and today they have been officially eliminated from playoff contention,36,0,0,nba,Just shows that you shouldn’t be saying that before it happens if you haven’t ever made the playoffs ever. Over confidence got to them but still they have a very bright future.
405,76ers Big 5 line up over their first 10 games average 122.2 ppg while allowing 113.4ppg. 8-2 record.,58,60,0,nba,"W vs Den: 117-110

W vs LAL: 143-120

L vs Bos: 109-112

W vs Nyk: 126-111

W vs Ind: 106-89

W vs Sac: 123-114

W vs MIL: 130-125

W vs BOS: 118-114

L vs ATL: 127-129

W vs BKN: 123-110

Over their total season it’s a +7ppg on O but interestingly a +1.3 on D. On top of that with Ennis missing the last two games Shake has been getting some minutes and even had 2 more than TJ last night in minutes. Brett previously stated that he doesn’t see Milton, or Smith for that matter, being playoff factors. However, if Milton continues to get minutes over the final 8 games of the season, and delivers he could squeak in. Assuming shake steps up a playoff lineup of Simmons, Redick, Butler, Harris, Embiid, Ennis, Shake, Scott maybe giving TJ at most 5 minutes to bring up the energy and boban as well if match ups allowed could be the formula for success. Brett previously stated he wants an 8-9 man playoff rotation with rare instances of the 10 man getting on the court.

407,Greater upset- Cavs beating Warriors in 2016 vs Giants beating Patriots in 2008?,38,0,0,nba,"I know this sub is full of homers who will say 2016 was the greater upset, but I genuinely think 2008 was the greater upset. You had a 16-0 team, one of the greatest lineups of all time and the first undefeated season since the 72 dolphins, up against a Giants team with young Eli at QB that barely made it into the postseason. That Patriots team was better in every way but the Giants managed to beat them in the biggest Superbowl game of this generation. Even Bill Simmons was predicting a 30 point blowout for the Patriots.

Cavs Warriors 2016 was impressive but the Cavs had the greatest player of this generation + Kyrie + Love and had won a game against them the previous year with just Lebron. Plus Warriors were missing Draymond in one game with greatly helped them. But I was wondering if people here considered 2008 a greater upset than 2016"
408,"If Harden keeps even 80% from his scoring in the playoffs, it’s going to be hard to not call him the best player in the world",29,0,0,nba,"80% of this scoring would be 29 ppg. 90% would be like 32 ppg. If he maintains this level of efficiency even despite suffering a natural drop in volume(like most players not named Lebron do), I feel like it’s going to be tough to not have him as the best player in the world. To be able to score this efficiently at this high of a volume without having the same level of talent that Steph/KD have around them is monstrous."

Denver and Portland as 2/3 could battle for the right to be the lame duck Conference Finalist (just like 07 Jazz), and thats assuming they win round 1 which won't be easy"
414,[OC] The Make or Break Month for the Kemba Walker Era in Charlotte,30,47,0,nba,"When the Charlotte Hornets (then Bobcats) drafted Kemba Walker with the # 9 pick back in 2011, I had my doubts. Walker's draft stock had risen based on some clutch play during the NCAA tournament, but had every telltale sign of becoming an inefficient ""chucker"" in the NBA. And over his first four seasons in the league, that appeared to play out. Even in year 4, he shot 38.5% from the field and 30.4% from the three point line.
 
But a funny thing happened on the way to my foregone conclusion: Walker evolved. He got better and better. He developed a more consistent shot and step-back and has become a 3-time All-Star. More than that, he's earned raves for his work ethic and leadership. In some ways, he is Damian Lillard Lite (which I intend as a compliment.) Like Lillard, he has put his entire franchise on his back and pushed them as far as he can.

The question is: is that far enough? Hamstrung by a mediocre supporting cast and poor front office decisions, Walker and the Hornets have only made two playoff appearances and lost in the first round both times. They continue to flounder around on the fringes of the playoffs and the late lottery, seemingly stuck in basketball purgatory forever.
 
Well, not forever. Not anymore. This summer will be a defining moment and crucial crossroads for this team. They already have a projected $90M committed in salary for next season, and that doesn't factor in Kemba Walker -- an unrestricted free agent. After another career year (25.2 points, 5.9 assists), he's going to be an expensive one, too. Whether he earns the full ""max"" or not, he's going to at least double his current contract (criminally underpaid at $12M over the last few seasons.)
 
Michael Jordan's wallet will be tested by more than Kemba Walker alone. SG Jeremy Lamb is *also* a free agent this summer, and is *also* coming off a career year (with 15.1 points and 5.6 rebounds.) Still only 26, Lamb will be a hot commodity himself this summer.

So what does Jordan do? Bring it back? Or blow it up? That decision may be TBD, based on the end results of this year. After a four game winning streak, the Hornets find themselves at 35-39, within striking distance of the playoff field (Miami is currently 8th at 37-38.) They may make it. They may not. But the implications go further than a mere R1 appearance. In fact, this stretch run may be the critical and defining moment of Walker (and Jordan’s) entire run with the organization. It is absolutely a **make or break** month for the team.
 
**MAKE**
 
There's a prevalent ""championship or bust!"" attitude from the media and some fans, but it's not reflective of *every* franchise. Some have more modest hopes than that. For a team like Charlotte that tends to be overlooked and at times downright ignored, making the playoffs would be an achievement worth pursuing.
 
And if the Hornets can indeed rattle off some wins and make the playoffs this year, then that's an achievement that they may be able to get used to. Virtually their entire core is under 30 years old, which suggests that they will only be better next season with another year of development and another year in first-year coach James Borrego's system.
 
Of course, there's that pesky little matter of free agency to worry about. As mentioned, Walker and Lamb will both be free agents and both in line for a massive pay raise. Both Walker and Lamb are represented by agent Jeff Schwartz at Excel Management, but there's no chance that he gives them a package deal discount. Not after Walker's made so little (relatively) in his NBA career. Walker's salary alone would drive the Hornets into the luxury tax, and retaining Lamb would jack that price tag even further.
 
That said, the idea of keeping Walker (and Lamb) is not *impossible.* That $90M in projected salary for next season factors in player options for Michael Kidd-Gilchrist ($13M) and Bismack Biyombo ($17M). If the team wants to keep MKG in the long term, they can approach him about accepting a reduced rate extension -- maybe 2 years/$20M or 3 years/$30M, whatever -- with the idea of trimming their cap hit for next season alone. If that doesn't work, you can float MKG to other teams to see if they would take a flier on the former # 2 pick (without giving back any money in return.)
 
As for Biyombo? He's taking that $17M next season to the bank. He's swatting away talks of renegotiation quicker than a blocked shot in a contract year. But the Hornets can still try to get that number off their sheet. They can consider the idea of attaching Biyombo's contract to an asset (like a Malik Monk or a few R2 picks) to shed the salary. 
 
And worst case? We can't forget about the ""stretch"" provision, which would be apt for Biyombo in more ways than one. As far as I understand it, stretching a contract spreads the money out to twice the length of the deal + 1 year. So effectively, rather than pay Biyombo $17M for next season, the Hornets would pay him $6M + $6M + $6M over the next three years -- a savings of $10M+ off next year's cap. If you want to get nuts, you can do the same and stretch MKG, which would result in a total savings of nearly $20M to help reduce the luxury tax. The Hornets will have more money coming off the cap in the future (Marvin Williams' contract expires the following year, for example) that would allow them to survive those extra years of stretched money.
 
So the moral of the story? The Hornets theoretically *can* roll this team back for next season if they want to roll up their sleeves and dig their heels in.
 
**or BREAK**
 
Now what happens if Charlotte fails to rally into the playoffs? It's hard to imagine Michael Jordan and the ownership group will greenlight an expensive sequel.
 
While it may be difficult for the franchise to let Kemba Walker walk, we have to be cold-hearted and pragmatic here. Walker may be a legitimate All-Star player, but there are concerns about handing him a 4 year max salary. He's a great player -- not a *transcendent* player. His shooting splits have improved over the years, but he's hovered between 55.1-57.2% in true shooting over the last four seasons. The league average in the NBA right now is above 55%. Moreover, Walker's size limits him on the defensive end, where he grades as a -0.92 impact according to ESPN's real plus/minus. As Walker rounds the corner and approaches 30 (he's 28 now), those concerns should escalate.
 
It's also fair to wonder about the ""fit"" between Walker and new coach James Borrego. Borrego developed his coaching chops in the San Antonio Spurs system, wherein defense, size, and ball movement tends to take priority. Under Gregg Popovich's reign, the Spurs never relied on one guard to carry their scoring like Walker does for Charlotte. Walker has averaged 22+ points for Charlotte for three seasons in a row. For the Spurs, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili played a combined 33 seasons and neither averaged over 22 points in any single year. (Although Ginobili played limited minutes, to be fair.)
 
Because the Hornets did not trade Kemba Walker (or Jeremy Lamb), they will receive nothing in return if they shuffle out the door. Where does that leave the team? With an expensive ($90M, remember) roster, and one lacking premier young talent. Malik Monk still hasn't found his footing in Year 2, and Miles Bridges looks more like a future starter than future star. This is a team in desperate need of a superstar.
 
Given that, the Hornets are a prime candidate to completely ""blow it up"" and crash down to the bottom of the standings. Of course, that process is not as easy as it used to be in the days of Sam Hinkie. The flattened lottery odds give the ""top"" (aka worst) team only a 14% chance to land the # 1 pick in the draft, and only a 52% chance of even cracking the top 4. Can this franchise and this market survive a potentially long and dreary winter as the team rebuilds and fishes for a franchise defining talent? It's hard to say.

At the end of the day, that's what makes this decision so hard to figure out. Neither choice looks certain; Robert Frost himself may be stumped trying to pick a path here. Do they double down on this current team? Or do they cash in their chips and start over? I have a feeling that decision will depend on these next few weeks of action.

415,AD Trade Idea with Indiana,10,0,0,nba,"Indiana fans: would you be willing to trade conference affiliation for Anthony Davis? Like forget salary matching or first round picks, but basically you get AD and from now on are in the Western Conference? New Orleans gets nothing but to go East? You'd be good next year but there's no guarantee AD would stay past that, and you'd be permanently stuck with one of the worst travel schedules ever long after the Brow has retired. 

I don't think the West is that much better than the East at the top, and maybe you get to avoid playing in the same conference as the Sixers dynasty just as the W's go into decline? I think I'd take it. Curious to hear your thoughts."

423,Do Teams Give Up On Players Too Early?,73,23,0,nba,"With most of the early picks in the draft one-and-done players, are teams giving up on their potential stars too young? I look at a guy like Markelle Fultz for instance. He's 20, about to be 21 years old and was traded for pennies on the dollar because of a nagging shoulder injury. You have to remember old era guys that put up ridiculous rookie and sophmore numbers, a lot of the times were 21-23 years old entering the league - some older. Even more recent stars were older.

Steph Curry was 21 entering the league. John Stockton was 22 and garbage until his 3rd year - same with Steve Nash. Kidd was 21. The list goes on.

I'm not defending Fultz, I just used him as an example. These one-and-done players need time to improve and need time for the team to get better around them. It'll get worse in a couple of years when we get fresh out of high school players, and I really see why there are so many people against the one-and-done rule."

425,"The Nets are currently suffering the worst attendance of the NBA’s 30 teams, at 14,639 a game, and 'was not making any money as recently as last year'",117,242,0,nba,"According to the NY Post anyway.

&gt;&gt; The Nets are currently suffering the worst attendance of the NBA’s 30 teams, at 14,639 a game, even though their game has improved enough that they are poised to make the playoffs for the first time in four years.

&gt;&gt; The team was not making any money as recently as last year, one sports exec said.

&gt;&gt; By selling a minority stake to Tsai, Prokhorov immediately reduced his costs associated with the team. In an agreement signed with the NBA last year, Tsai and Prokhorov agreed to provide the Nets with the extra funding the team needs to meet its expenses and payment obligations, research firm Moody’s Investors Service said in a research note.

&gt;&gt; A change in ownership could also help shore up the Barclays Center, which opened with a splash in 2012 but which has been struggling to make a profit.

&gt;&gt; Last June, Moody’s projected Barclays — which cost $1 billion to build and drew rapper Jay-Z as an investor — would break even in 2018.

&gt;&gt; One of the financial drags on the arena has been the New York Islanders hockey team, which also plays there and which has been suffering from poor attendance and sponsorships.

427,[OC] How Milwaukee exploited Harden's inability to pass accurately with his right hand and his feast or famine approach to scoring,424,2461,0,nba,"All credit to Mike Zavagno, one of the best NBA Twitter follows out there, his Twitter handle is @MZavagno11.

&amp;nbsp;


Zavagno [charted all of Harden's passes last night](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2sUeXYXQAAOT3y.jpg:large). One big takeaway - by forcing him right so dramatically, the Bucks are able to take away most competitive passes to the right corner. This makes him attempt tougher R to L passes. 

---

&amp;nbsp;


Harden almost never throws the ball backwards. Note DJ Wilson's positioning on the floor [here](https://streamable.com/ji9kp). MIL can have him crash down into the paint, allowing Lopez to help on Harden because of this.

---

&amp;nbsp;

[Here](https://streamable.com/xkgwf) you see Wilson immediately crash into the paint again once Harden wins at the point of attack. Note not that Harden makes the pass to House but HOW he makes it. He has to pass left-handed which is both slow and off target (and will be relevant throughout the game).


---
&amp;nbsp;

[This one](https://streamable.com/tvbrp) is more subtle, but important. Even with this mismatch (Ilyasova on ball, Hil on Capela), MIL remains in the same defense. With Hill stepping up, Middleton crashes down on Capela's OUTSIDE shoulder, remaining in the corner passing lane. This funnels Harden into a lob.


---
&amp;nbsp;

[Here](https://streamable.com/udgq0) Harden's foul drawing tendencies can put him in feast or famine situations. Notice Wilson crashing down again. Harden has the quick left hand pass to Tucker for an above the break 3 (Tucker shoots it at 36%) but tries to go through WIlson and turns it over.

---

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's](https://streamable.com/936k3) probably the single best pass of the night from Harden. Sees Wilson crashing to take away the paint yet again and is able to thread a clean bounce pass into Shumpert's shooting pocket from right to left (note that the pass is still left-handed).

---

&amp;nbsp;


[Contrast the pass above with this one](https://streamable.com/7mfjs). Essentially the same situation, except Harden gets deeper in his initial drive. This allows Bledsoe to recover and disrupt Harden's attempt at a left-handed pass to Shumpert. Connaughton is able to recover and contest the shot.

---

&amp;nbsp;

[This](https://streamable.com/9faql) was the only time in the entire game Harden was able to make his patented bullet pass to the left corner with the left hand. Middleton was a bit slow reacting on the weakside and Tucker was left wide open in the corner when Giannis crashed down. But Tucker airballs the shot.


---
&amp;nbsp;

A couple things on [this](https://streamable.com/8rcxm):
Wilson (PJ's man) contesting allows Lopez to stay home
The spacing of House floating to the corner with Tucker crashing down makes it easy for MIL to guard them with one man.
Connaughton crashing from the strong side but Harden doesn't throw a pass R to L.


---
&amp;nbsp;

[Another example](https://streamable.com/beie6) where the mix of HOUs spacing and Harden's distinct limitations as a passer play right into MIL's hands. The R corner stack allows MIL to guard them with one man. But, even if Rivers is on the R wing, no evidence Harden will throw that pass. Thus, WIlson can crash.


---
&amp;nbsp;

[Here](https://streamable.com/noqwh) again you can see Harden's inability to throw a pass with his right hand derailing a possession against this specific defense. He is able to pass with neither pace nor accuracy here to Rivers -- which allows Middleton to close the airspace and force a reset.


---
&amp;nbsp;

Note the difference in spacing [here](https://streamable.com/btzm4) which completely changes the possession. Instead of two men on the same side, Tucker is alone on the right side. When Giannis goes to crash down, there's nobody to fill his spot -- leaving Tucker with  a wide open 3.


---
&amp;nbsp;

[Houston tries to go 5-out against Lopez](https://streamable.com/ycz1b) and it looks like it should work. Lopez and Bledsoe both follow Harden, leaving Clark wide open at the top of the key for a trail 3. But MIL bets once again that Harden will not make this pass and wins in the form of a nasty Bledsoe block.

But he told The Athletic he has “no idea” if he would accept the still theoretical offer if he were to end up on an All-NBA team and the Wizards were to subsequently propose it to him this summer.
“I have no idea. … I try not to (think about it),” he said. “I’m not gonna be naïve to it. I know about it. But … I haven’t even gotten that far, because I need to figure out what we’re gonna do in this offseason, where we’re going, which direction we’re going.”

Beal recently said at a fan event over All-Star Weekend in Charlotte that he wanted to remain a Wizard for the long haul.

“If I can retire in this jersey, I will,” he said. “I’m all about loyalty.”
He told Yahoo! Sports in a podcast later that day, “If I can, 100 percent, I’d die in a Wizards jersey.”

438,The lack of media coverage for The Pacers is really annoying.,29,0,0,nba,"The Pacers are an incredibly fun and exciting team this year! The chemistry is great and each player provides something to the team weather it is shooting,  assisting,  playmaking,  etc. 

THEY LOST OLADIPO AND THE'RE STILL BALLIN! Bogdan seems to know where to be at the right place at the right time. Sabonis is the leading player in double doubles off the bench and knows where every player is at a given time. Myles Turner is the leading player in blocked shots. I could keep going. 

I have watched literally more Pacer games this year than every other year combined. They play amazing basketball it's kind of a shame that not a lot of people are watching them. 

Sorry for the rant. "
439,Would this be the best way to get rid of Andrew Wiggins?,51,0,0,nba,"http://tradenba.com/trades/rkl5i02OE


Why the Wolves do it: Its hard to get a superstar to come to Minnesota, so a trade is the best way to get KAT some help. They are probably letting Jeff Teague go this offseason, so Conley would be a great point guard to replace him with. They also get rid of Wiggins' albatross contract, which they would be stuck with for 5 years. I think 3 firsts is an OK amount to give up when you are clearing up a shitty contract and replacing it with 3 years of a much better player. Besides, those picks are not going to be very high anyway because their team is not bad enough to tank with KAT on the roster. 


Why the Grizz do it: Mike Conley has to go, as he's the only good player on the team (besides Bruno). They will definetly be unintentionally tanking for the next few years, as they will have a very hard time getting anyone to sign in Memphis. They could use these 3 picks to either trade for a star or sit tight and try to get lucky in the draft. Wiggins contract will not be a huge issue because they will have almost nobody on the books next year, and free agency won't be very eventful for them even if they had cap space.


TLDR: Grizzlies get picks for the tank and Wolves get rid of Wiggins and get KAT some help. "

Also because the Spurs have some games remaining that they'll likely lose (@Washington, @denver) and I doubt they go any higher than 7th seed with the Clippers/jazz having easy schedules and refusing to lose. 

I guess the obvious second choice would be the Thunder but I think they'll pull enough games out of their ass to dodge GSW and probably play denver round 1.

Also side note but I'm always so surprised when I see that the thunder have the same record as the Spurs who once lost 6 out of 7 games and got blown out by 30 points like 3 times in a week. Pop would win 60 games easy with that roster. What are they doing? "

Edit: Took out Draymond."
476,"[Serious] Is Curry just as dependent on the Warriors system, as it is on him?",27,0,0,nba,"The consensus is that Steph Curry is what makes the Golden State system tick as it revolves around him. This is imo spot on and an undeniable fact, we've seen how the team doesn't look the same or perform the same when he isn't on the floor.

Vice-versa, is Curry's success significantly amplified by the system he's been part of for over half a decade now? The Golden State roster even before KD joined was designed to cover his deficiencies and maximise his positives (this is why I respect the Warriors, despite how easy it might seem to the average r/NBA user, loads of team have failed to put the ideal system in place around their star player).

As the 2016 Cavs showed, the best way to disrupt Curry is by throwing everything you've got at him to stop him from getting even a glimpse of a look. It's chaotic, it's creates mistakes but it's literally the only way. The Warriors have had arguably the GOAT off the ball player and fellow top 5 shooter Klay Thompson, who guarantees that you can't really throw everyone at Curry without leaving one of the greatest shooters wide open. Add to this Kevin fucking Durant and you can't really focus on Curry without inevitably giving points up. 

Defense is 100% a negative for Steph. He's adequate at times and always puts in the grind and hustle but teams target him in the playoffs. The Warriors have adjusted through 2 time all NBA defender Andre Iguodala, former DPOY and since regular candidate Draymond Green and Klay, who is a top tier perimeter defender. To generate open looks for Steph and company, Warriors operated with the GOAT screen machine Andrew Bogut, who was also a pretty good rebounder.

The entire Warriors system is built from scratch to give Curry exactly what he wants and needs. Would Curry be able to make the adjustment from tailor-made, long familiar surroundings to something completely new? How good would Curry be if he had to move to a situation where the roster wasn't completely built to complement him?"

What about Dray though? How integral/important is he to the team? This of course assuming he stays healthy and his play doesdn't drop off. 

There are two scenarios. I would like to see what the sub thinks in both of these --

1. KD signs and Dray leaves.

2. KD leaves and Dray leaves too.

Obviously this is a testament to how good the Spurs are, but I think it is funny that people are ""increasingly optimistic"" that he stay based on how good the Raptors are when this is technically one of the worst seasons of his career win percentage wise. 

Oh and it should also be noted that this is despite the Raptors playing in the easier eastern conference. "

The full segment:

&gt;""I think he's dynamic in his play, which two of those guys are. I think he has leadership skills, which two of those players have. He is the only one who has a true position and can play his position on both ends of the floor. And impact the game because of his speed and his ability to be the best player at his position on the floor.

&gt;You can see a lot of different people playing with him. I believe Tatum is a complementary player so far as he's shown. He's a really good 2nd or 3rd best player.

&gt;I think Mitchell is a really good player... Think he's a unique player. And Simmons obviously because of good size, he can effect the game.

&gt;But I think Fox is the easiest to plug into any team and would have an immediate impact because of the way he plays and the fact that Mitchell is the only guy close to the leadership part of it. I think [Fox's] team feeds off him, the organization feeds off him. Would Mitchell be the same player if he doesn't have Rudy behind him? Or doesn't have Rubio getting the ball?

Sure enough, he’s got the opportunity to do so.

Should the Cardinals draft Kyler first overall? That’s a debate that has been discussed at length over the past few weeks that I’m not going to get into. But what we can do is take a look at the history of teams giving up on their QBs after just one season, and deciding to take a QB in the first round the following year. Here’s a look at every instance in NFL history of a team drafting a QB in the first round in back-to-back seasons:

**Team** | **Year of First Pick** | **QB** | **Year of Second Pick** | **QB** | **Notes**
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Detroit Lions | 1948 | YA Tittle | 1949 | John Rauch | The fact that the Lions took a QB one year after taking YA Tittle, a Hall of Famer, makes more sense than you might think. The Lions drafted Tittle with the 6th pick of the 1948 NFL Draft; however, the Baltimore Colts of the upstart All-America Football Conference picked him, and Tittle decided to pick the Colts. So even though the Lions used their first round pick on a QB, they never actually got that QB. As for Rauch… he, too, decided to forgo playing for the Lions, and instead joined the New York Yankees of the AAFC
Baltimore Colts | 1954 | Cotton Davidson | 1955 | George Shaw | This is a case of a team giving up on a QB after one season. Davidson was the team’s punter as well in 1954, but in his appearances as a QB, he went 28-for-64 with 0 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. His passer rating that season was an abysmal 26.1. Because of this, the Colts decided to cut their losses and take George Shaw in the first round in 1955. He was better by default, playing 4 seasons with the Colts and throwing 21 touchdown passes. However, in 1956 after a solid rookie season, he broke his leg, which paved the way for someone by the name of Johnny Unitas to take over the starting job. The rest is history.
San Francisco 49ers | 1956 | Earl Morrall | 1957 | John Brodie | Morrall had a very good NFL career, as he is most known for leading the Baltimore Colts in 1968 to Super Bowl III and for his contributions to the Dolphins’ Super Bowl VII undefeated team. However, his stint with the 49ers in 1956 was not good, as he threw 1 touchdown and 6 interceptions his rookie year. The 49ers decided to trade him to Pittsburgh in 1957 for linebacker Marv Matuszak and two 1st round picks. The trade worked out, all things considered; Matuszak made the Pro Bowl in 1957, and Brodie played for the 49ers until 1973. He finished his career with 214 touchdown passes and 31,548 passing yards; when he retired in 1973, he had the 4th most passing yards and the 8th most passing touchdowns in league history.
Washington Redskins | 1959 | Don Allard | 1960 | Richie Lewis | When Washington drafted Allard in 1959, they refused to offer him more than $7,000 for the season. Along came the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL, offering $13,500 for his services. You can probably guess which team he decided to play for. Because of this, Washington tried again in 1960 with Richie Lewis. He, too, spurned Washington to play with the Buffalo Bills of the upstart American Football League
Washington Redskins | 1960 | Richie Lewis | 1961 | Norm Snead | For the third straight year, Washington tried their luck, hoping to get a QB that would play for them. Eventually, they found their man in Norm Snead. In 3 seasons with Washington, he made it to two Pro Bowls, though he led the league in interceptions in 1963 and went just 9-30-3 as the starter. While Snead had a very good NFL career, Washington won in the long run when they traded him to Philadelphia in 1964 for Sonny Jurgensen, a Hall of Fame QB who led the league in passing yards 3 times with Washington
Los Angeles Rams | 1962 | Roman Gabriel | 1963 | Terry Baker | Roman Gabriel ended up playing 11 seasons with the Rams, making it to the Pro Bowl three times with them and throwing for over 22,000 yards and 154 TDs in his time with the Rams. But in 1962, he went 0-3-1 as a starter, throwing just 3 touchdowns in 6 appearances. Over the final 3 games of the season (all starts), he threw for just 324 yards, 0 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, posting a 55.5 passer rating. So the Rams decided to cut their losses and take Terry Baker. He threw 0 touchdowns and 4 interceptions as a rookie on 19 passing attempts. Not good.
Los Angeles Rams | 1963 | Terry Baker | 1964 | Bill Munson | Terry Baker looked atrocious as a rookie, and while Roman Gabriel looked better in 1963, he was still not great. He went 5-4 as a starter, but only threw 8 touchdowns in 9 games and only completed 46.3% of his passes. So they tried again in 1964 with Bill Munson. While Munson actually went onto be a halfway-decent QB in Detroit for eight seasons, he struggled with the Rams, going 3-13-2 as the starter with 19 touchdowns and 29 interceptions. Eventually, after striking out with Munson, the Rams went back to Gabriel, who then proceeded to become one of the best QBs in the NFL. How that all worked out, I have no idea.
Miami Dolphins | 1966 | Rick Norton | 1967 | Bob Griese | With their first pick as an expansion team, the Dolphins chose Rick Norton. As a rookie he did not play well, completing just 38.2% of his passes and throwing 6 interceptions on 55 attempts. They decided to take Bob Griese in 1967 because of this. He made it to eight Pro Bowls, won two Super Bowls, and made the Hall of Fame. Perhaps no team exemplified “giving up on your first round pick and having it work out” better than Miami. As for Norton, he finished his career with 7 touchdowns and 30 interceptions. Even by the old football standards of the 1960s, that’s atrocious.
Baltimore Colts | 1982 | Art Schlichter | 1983 | John Elway | The Colts had the right idea by taking a QB in the most stacked class of all-time, as they definitely took the better QB here. They were right to give up on Art, as he was suspended in 1983 for a gambling suspension (so they needed a QB either way that season), and finished his career with 3 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and an 0-6 record (he threw 0 touchdowns and 2 interceptions in 1982). The only problem was that Elway made it very clear that he did not want to play for the Colts. Turns out, he never did. Elway ended up playing for the Broncos and became one of the greatest QBs of all-time.

---

It’s only happened 9 times before, but hasn’t happened in nearly 35 years. Three times (Detroit in 1948/49, Washington in 1959/60, Washington in 1960/61), it was because their first round pick refused to play for them, so those have to be placed in a different category. That’s not a case of a team giving up on their QB; that’s a case of the player not even playing for them. That leaves six cases in NFL history of a team truly giving up on their QB after one season. Of the five:

- The Colts got it right with Shaw over Davidson, though it ended up not mattering in the end, as Johnny Unitas eventually became the team’s QB for the next decade and a half once Shaw broke his leg.

- The 49ers got it right with Brodie over Morrall. For as good as Morrall was, Brodie finished his career as an arguable HOF-snub, and was putting up some of the best numbers in league history up until that point.

- The Rams struck out twice with Baker and Munson. They had their guy all along in Roman Gabriel.

- The Dolphins hit a home run with Griese over Norton. Rick Norton was atrocious by the standards of any era, and Bob Griese was a Hall of Fame QB who helped the Dolphins win their only two titles in franchise history.

- And the Colts had the right idea by giving up on Art, but they whiffed on Elway by taking a guy that explicitly said he was not going to play for them

Make of this evidence what you will. Just know that giving up on a first round QB after one year, while not unprecedented, hasn’t happened in over 50 years, and has a somewhat mixed success rate. However, while the success rate is somewhat mixed, it does skew toward the second QB taken being better than the first QB."

29,Countdown to the draft: The best players to be drafted 26th overall in the NFL Draft,50,156,0,nfl,"Hello everyone,

As of today, there are 26 days left until the first round of the NFL Draft begins, and this is a continuation of my countdown to the draft, where I will be outlining the best players taken at each draft slot from 32 to 1. Today is the 26th overall pick, which is currently held by the Colts this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 26th overall:

Player|Position|Draft Year|Team|Career AV|Notes
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Ray Lewis|LB|1996|BAL|221|HOF
Alan Faneca|G|1998|PIT|146|Future HOF
Joe DeLamielleure|G|1973|BUF|111|HOF
Jim Harbaugh|QB|1987|CHI|101|
Dave Brown|CB|1975|PIT|99|
Duane Brown|T|2008|HOU|98|

Dana Stubblefield|DT|1993|SF|88|
Robert Porcher|DE|1992|DET|84|
Billy Ray Smith|DE|1957|LAR|81|AV not recorded before 1960

If you think of someone who you think should be added, let me know!

Tomorrow, we’ll get to the 25th overall pick.

I.e. i have found some results on needing to pay each of the current teams a fee for entry, owners/organizations can not be tied to gambling, etc. but I have not found anything concrete on the rules &amp; process required when considering a team for expansion / for a team to be considered. The only results I found on google were for a league expansion draft, but this occurs after a team has already been accepted and is only regarding rules for player selection. I'm looking for the previous step to this, the process and rules a team must go through and abide by in order to be considered for expansion. I found a few things in the NFL bylaws/constitution, but again, relatively incomplete.

70,32 All-Time Teams / 32 Days - Tampa Bay Buccaneers All-Time 53 Man Roster,22,26,0,nfl,"Hello r/NFL.  For this series of 32 in 32 we're covering the all-time 53-Man roster for each team.   In this case, it's the Tampa Bay Buccaneers!   

&amp;#x200B;

There really have been three distinct eras for the Bucs.   The 70s/80s is when the team was finding its way going winless in the inaugural '76 campaign, winning the division in '79, but generally not doing a whole lot that anyone cared about.  That all changed in the mid 90s when Sam Wyche drafted two specific first round players that would change the direction of this moribund franchise forever.  Derrick Brooks and Warren Sapp.  They, along with John Lynch and Ronde Barber would set the foundation of what would become IMO the greatest defense of all time in the 2001 and 2002 seasons which culminated in the franchise's only Super Bowl win over new HC Jon Gruden's old team - the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl 37.  They would be extremely up and down in the years after, as salary cap issues forced the departure of many key players (Sapp, Lynch).  After the 2008 season, Jon Gruden was dismissed and pretty much every year since then has been lost, as the franchise is now on its fifth head coach in the decade since.  

&amp;#x200B;

With that in mind, there are obviously plenty of players on this roster from the peak 90s to early 00s, but there are some absolute studs to be found in the early years, and even some current players which rank very highly in team history despite the struggles the team as a whole has experienced.   

&amp;#x200B;

Some may take issue with having Brad Johnson ahead of Jameis, given that James has all sorts of franchise QB records.  Well, there is one that no other Bucs QB has, and that's about playoff wins.   Specifically, a Super Bowl.  I believe James can get there, but he isn't at that level yet.  

&amp;#x200B;

Other players like Randall McDaniel at guard might raise an eyebrow as well, but he is a hall of fame player, produced as a Buc, and even earned Pro-Bowl honors with Tampa.  This also highlights a particularly weak area of the Bucs franchise history which we will get to later.  

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors that helped shape the roster are of course longevity, post-season honors, statistics, special teams and occasionally my personal affinity for a player as well.  It should be noted however that even if I happened to like a player, I didn't specifically exclude anyone I believe to be more worthy (on purpose).  

&amp;#x200B;

With all of these caveats and explanations out of the way, I present to you the all-time Buccaneers 53-man roster.

&amp;#x200B;

Strengths -  Defense.  The Tampa-2 is literally named after this franchise because they ran it so damn well.  Several hall of famers (Selmon, Sapp, Brooks, , and a few more that deserve to be (Lynch, Barber, Rice).  A (very rare) Super Bowl MVP Safety in Dexter Jackson, and he won that award despite the other safety scoring two INT returns for TD! (Dwight Smith).  

&amp;#x200B;

Skill players.  Mike (Mark?) Alstott can [bludgeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLLs8fViVF8) any team to death, [Mike Evans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gvkKGgqkIE) and Vincent Jackson were an excellent tandem when they played together, and the TE group is really good too.  Jimmie Giles may not have the name recognition nationally, but he's a legend in Tampa.  The four-time Pro-Bowler played from 78 to 86 in Tampa, caught 279 passes for 4,300 yards and 34 touchdowns.  This was in an era that didn't feature TEs near as prominently as the league does now.  

&amp;#x200B;

Weaknesses - O-Line.  Paul Gruber was admittedly fantastic (fourth person inducted into current ring of honor).   Randall McDaniel and Jeff Christy played for the Bucs for two years.   That should tell you about the type of guys we have to pick from.  They generally either played for Tampa not very long - but at a high level.  Or, they had a Very Good Career with the Bucs, but aren't exactly legends (Penn, Joseph, Marpet, Dotson).  O-line is definitely the weakness here.  At least we didn't have to start Caleb Benenoch and Kenyatta Walker on this team though, right?   

&amp;#x200B;

Coaching Staff.   I don't think anyone could argue that Hall of Famer Tony Dungy had the best (at the very least, defensive) staffs in Bucs history.   His tree is littered with greatness.   Monte Kiffin was such a good D-coordinator that Jon had to keep him for his entire tenure too.   Then you throw in guys like Mike Tomlin, Herm Edwards, Lovie Smith, Mike Shula, Rod Marinelli, Joe Barry etc.  And that's just from his days in Tampa.  

&amp;#x200B;

One last interesting fact.   While a good TE, he was a very good long snapper.  TE Dave Moore played 13 years in Tampa.   Part of 92 - 2001, and again from 2004 - 2006.   He made his only pro bowl at 37 years old.   This timeline also means the two years he was in Buffalo, he missed out on the super bowl win.   That sucks particularly because he helped build the thing in the decade prior.  He is now a color commentator on the buccaneers radio network.

99,Why didn’t a run-first team want a volume runner like Jordan Howard? Is he just not a good enough athlete?,172,149,0,nfl,"Bears fans are complaining he only went for a 6th, but really it’s because none of the run-first teams wanted him.  On a run-first team he would be worth more than that probably, but nobody wanted him. He was signed to a scatback team, a skill set he sucks at (besides blocking).

Howard is a downhill tailback guy that takes volume carries to bust one, something many coaches today are reluctant to do because they let the fans coach for them, and the fans have declared that “run run pass” doesn’t work, without realizing that the entire point is to run as many run plays as possible to as many different gaps as possible from as many formations as possible, to soften up the defense for later in the game, keep them guessing on the type of run, and also to feel out which gaps might be easy to exploit later in the game.

There are teams run every play like that, but nobody wanted Howard as a primary guy, even a team with an injury prone HB like the Jags, or no primary guy like SF.  So as a secondary change of pace guy (like Tennessee would use) he’s not worth anything more than he is as a scatback to Philly, because neither of these things are volume downhill running.

So his only role can be as a primary volume HB that gets 30 carries a game who you build your team around.

The problem is that Howard isn’t really fast (DBs catch up to him) and he can’t break arm tackles in the hole. 

Does this mean he’s essentially just not good enough an athlete for the position he plays (volume tailback)??

Because 20 years ago he would have been traded for a 1st round pick to some hopeless QB-less team who says “fuck it, we have no shot, let’s trade a 1st for Jordan Howard and try to just ride him for 350 carries this year, we’ll have a better chance to win that way than by letting our qb (josh Allen/case keenum, etc) throw the ball more than about 10 times a game”. But that was when about 28/30 teams used a volume tailback, nowadays because only like 6/32 teams are using one, only the very best athletes can survive as volume tailbacks. So again, since Howard isn’t among the very best athletes at volume tailback, does this mean he’s basically screwed??"

This team is amazing!  It has a top 3 all-time QB, a top 2 all-time WR, and a top 5 all-time CB.  The o-line which has several potential Hall of Famers (Saturday and Faneca), would give Manning all-day to get the ball two Ward and Moss. The defensive line may not be great but several of those linebackers should help shore the run defense.  


This was also a great draft for Centers with several of them making the team as out of position Guards.  Two players who would have made most other teams were Michael Lewis and Ike Reese, both Pro Bowl Special Teamers.  


Future Hall of Famers I see from this team are Peyton Manning and Charles Woodson (Obvious).  I also think Al Faneca gets in next year or the year after.  Jeff Saturday will probably get in eventually as well.  I don’t see Hines Ward getting into the Hall in the near future but eventually I think he makes it.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 27th overall:

:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
Dan Marino|QB|1983|MIA|216|HOF

138,32 NFL All-Time Teams in 32 Days (Day 5): All-Time Denver Broncos Roster,67,199,3,nfl,"I volunteered myself to name the all-time 53-man roster for the Denver Broncos because of my love for the team, my love of stats, and my love of writing. I'm not going to give you some long, hokey intro detailing the entire team's history, but I feel like it might be important to know my basis for selection.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, I only considered what each player did while they were with the Broncos. There may have been players with very storied careers who only played for the Broncos during their twilight years (or in the case of Jerry Rice, signed with us, found out he would be a depth player, and retired). Their careers outside of Denver will be disregarded and I will only base my selections on the body of work that was done while wearing a Broncos uniform.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, I did not use stats as the sole basis for my rankings. The Broncos will be entering their 60th season in 2019, and as such have existed through many different eras. The game has changed dramatically, and stats cannot be the only method of selection. Some players may have had a dramatic contribution to the team without flashy numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I feel like it's worth noting that while I have been a Broncos fan my entire life, I am only 30 and was not old enough to witness anyone before roughly the mid-90s. I've done a lot of outside research to make sure this isn't going to be filled with (too much) recency bias.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you won't all agree with my choices, so feel free to (civilly) give me your reasons for what you might have done differently.

&amp;#x200B;

Without further ado, I present to you the All-Time 53-man roster for the Denver Broncos:

&amp;#x200B;

**OFFENSE**:

&amp;#x200B;

**Quarterback**:

&amp;#x200B;

1.  John Elway *(1983-1998) -* The man, the myth, the legend. John Elway was the first QB drafted in one of the most historically great quarterback classes of all-time. He was also the most successful. He led the Broncos to 5 Super Bowl appearances (a record at the time of his retirement), 3 of which never happened as far as I'm concerned. By retiring after winning back-to-back Super Bowls, he set the bar so unbelievably high for what it means for an athlete to ""walk away while you're on top,"" that it will *hopefully* never be matched...I will leave a certain QB from Foxborough out of this conversation. When he retired, he held the records for most wins by a QB (148) and most fourth-quarter game-winning or game-tying drives (47). He also held the record for oldest QB ever to start in a Super Bowl at 38 years old. No player on this list is more important to this franchise than John Elway, and his ""legend"" status with the Broncos continues to grow to this day because of his outstanding work as their GM. If you wanted to illustrate Elway's greatness using only one memory, there's only one thing I want to say here tonight. It's only four words: ""This. One's For. John!"" 
2. Peyton Manning *(2012-2015)* \- This will likely be the only time that it's acceptable for Peyton Manning to be second on anyone's depth chart. Had he retired following his career with the Colts, he'd be a first-ballot hall of famer. However, his 4-year run of absolute dominance and demolition with the Broncos alone would likely also secure him a spot in Canton: 2x Pro Bowl selections, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, 2 Super Bowl appearances (1 win), 4 straight AFC West championships, single-season passing TDs record (55) and passing yards record (5,477), and the single-game passing TDs record (7). He broke John Elway's record for oldest QB ever to start in a Super Bowl at 39 years old and is the only QB in NFL history to win a Super Bowl with 2 different franchises. OMAHA!
3. Craig Morton *(1977-1982)* \- Another great quarterback who had a storied career prior to joining the Broncos, Craig Morton was traded to Denver in 1977 and led them to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history that season. In 6 seasons, he had a record of 41-23-0 (2-3 in the playoffs), 7 fourth-quarter comebacks, and 14 game-winning drives. He was the first QB in NFL history to start a Super Bowl with 2 different franchises (DAL - Super Bowl V), a record which would not be matched until Kurt Warner in Super Bowl XLIII.

&amp;#x200B;

*Honorable Mention:* Jake Plummer *(2003-2006)* \- I would be remiss to not mention Jake ""The Snake"", as he has one of my favorite NFL accomplishments of all time: He led the 2005 Broncos to be the first team ever to take down Tom Brady in the playoffs. This was obviously not a solo accomplishment, but this was such a big deal at the time that it felt like the team had already won the Super Bowl. God bless you for that, Mr. Plummer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Running Back**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Terrell Davis *(1995-2001)* \- The man who invented the Mile High Salute and helped finally push the Broncos over the hump to win their first and second Super Bowl championships. No one has ever accomplished as much in as little amount of time as TD. Seriously, he has the least number of games played (78) of any player elected to the Hall of Fame in the post-merger era by quite a bit. He won MVP in both the regular season and the Super Bowl, he was only the 4th player ever to rush for 2,000 yards in a single season, he broke (and still holds) the record for most rushing TDs in a Super Bowl (3), and he amassed an astounding 6,413 rushing yards, 1,181 receiving yards, and 61 total TDs over a 4 year span from 1995-1998.
2. Floyd Little *(1967-1975)* \- Little was the first Broncos running back selected to the Hall of Fame in 2010. He was a 5x All-Star with over 6,000 yards rushing in his career and 54 total career TDs. He was the Broncos first 1,000-yard rusher and won the NFL rushing title in 1971. He was a pioneer of multi-dimensional running backs and was a huge threat as both and a runner and a receiver.
3. Clinton Portis *(2002-2003)* \- This will likely be one of the most controversial choices I made on this list, but I decided to trust my gut on this one. I feel like I would wonder ""what could have been"" more often with Portis had it not been for what we got by trading him away: Champ Bailey. Clinton Portis won rookie of the year in 2002 thanks to posting 1,508 rushing yards and 1*7* total TDs. He followed that season up in 2003 with 1,591 rushing yards and 14 rushing TDs. If those numbers aren't enough for you to believe he earned this spot on the depth chart, his 5-touchdown, 218-yard game against the 11-1 Kansas City Chiefs should sway you.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fullback**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Howard Griffith *(1997-2000)* \- Griffith is quite possibly the most understated player on this list. He managed to create holes on a regular basis for Terrell Davis while simultaneously being a legitimate receiving threat. You don't often hear about FBs with 68 receptions for an entire career, let alone in 4 seasons. He also blocked for one-hit-wonder Olandis Gary (who had 1,159 yards in 1999) and Mike Anderson (who had 1,487 rushing yards in 2,000).

&amp;#x200B;

**Wide Receiver**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rod Smith *(1995-2006)* \- One of the greatest undrafted free agents of all time, Rod Smith stands alone atop a fairly impressive list of wide receivers who have worn the orange &amp; blue. He was the first undrafted player to reach 10,000 receiving yards and still holds the records for most receiving yards (11,389) and receiving TDs (68) of any undrafted player in NFL history. He also held the record for most receptions (849) by any undrafted player in NFL history when he retired. He still holds the Broncos franchise records in all 3 of those categories and was an integral part of both Broncos Super Bowl championship teams.
2. Demaryius Thomas *(2010-2018)* \- After Rod Smith, this particular group of players was very difficult to rank. Thomas stands out as a clear number 2 for me for several reasons: His outstanding performance in an otherwise dismal Super Bowl XLVIII is often forgotten. He set a Super Bowl record for receptions with 13 and tacked on 118 yards and the only TD the Broncos managed to score that day. His 80-yard receiving touchdown on the first play of OT in the 2011 Wild Card matchup against the Steelers is arguably one of the top 3 plays in Broncos history. He's 2nd in receiving yards and receiving TDs and 3rd in receptions on the Broncos all-time list. I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. DT was the man.
3. Lionel Taylor *(1960-1966)* \- This man put up modern day receiving numbers in an era where passing was an afterthought. He led the NFL in receptions 5 times (including the first 100-reception season in NFL history), was All-Pro 4 times, and finished his Broncos career with nearly 7,000 receiving yards, which is unheard of for the era he played in. What makes his numbers truly impressive is that he managed all of that despite an almost total lack of competent quarterback play. He played for the Broncos during the first 7 seasons that they were a franchise and never experienced a winning season with them once. That speaks volumes about how outstanding his production was.
4. Ed McCaffrey *(1995-2003)* \- McCaffrey certainly has the numbers to put himself high on this list, but he can't truly be appreciated without seeing him in action. He made so many spectacular catches, many of which were made while taking hits that would devastate other, lesser receivers. He regularly sacrificed his body to make important catches and was one of the most entertaining receivers of his time. He and Rod Smith were a hell of a tandem and a force to be reckoned with.
5. Emmanuel Sanders *(2014-Present)* \- Sanders joined the Broncos after the departure of Eric Decker, who many thought would be extremely difficult to replace. Not only has Sanders replaced him, he's surpassed him convincingly on this list. He's one of the best deep threats the Broncos have ever had, and even at 31 years old he hadn't seemingly lost a step and was still outrunning cornerbacks several years younger than him. He certainly still has time to move his way up this list.
6. Steve Watson *(1979-1987)* \- Consistently put up all-pro numbers during an era that, much like Taylor before him, was marred with inconsistent quarterback play. He averaged 17.3 yards per reception for his entire career, led the NFL in receiving touchdowns in 1981 with 13, and surpassed 1,000 yards receiving 3 times.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tight End**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Shannon Sharpe *(1990-1999, 2002-2003)* \- This is one of very few times where the #1 spot was absolutely not up for discussion. There has been a lot of debate recently about who the greatest TE of all-time is now that Rob Gronkowski has retired. Simply put: Rob Gronkowski does not exist without Shannon Sharpe. Sharpe changed the way the position was used forever by being the first tight end to be a *serious* receiving threat. He was a brutal blocker who could lay just about anyone out on their ass, and he was infamously one hell of a trash talker. He was selected to the Pro Bowl 7 consecutive times and was named 1st-team All-Pro 4 of those times. He totaled 675 receptions for 8,439 yards and 55 TDs during his Broncos career, was a key member of both Super Bowl Championship teams in the 90s, and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2011. There will never be another Shannon Sharpe.
2. Riley Odoms (*1972-1983)* \- Odoms was basically Shannon Sharpe before there was Shannon Sharpe. Looking at his career numbers in the rear view mirror doesn't properly do them justice, because TEs weren't primarily used as receivers. Odoms was a top-notch blocker and rarely missed his assignment, which helped him earn a trip to the Pro Bowl 4 times and 2 1st-team All-Pro accolades.
3. Julius Thomas *(2011-2014)* \- One of the reasons Thomas made this list despite such a short tenure with the team is that the Broncos don't have a rich history of tight ends beyond the two gentlemen named above. The other reason was that for 2 straight seasons, Julius Thomas was unstoppable. In his first 2 seasons, Julius Thomas played in 9 games and only started 1. But from 2013-2014, Julius Thomas looked like he could be the team's new Shannon Sharpe. Despite missing 5 games in that span, he still managed to haul in 107 receptions for 1,277 yards and 24 TDs. He caught a franchise-record 12 TDs in 2013, then tied his own franchise record the very next season. While he may have been a flash in the pan, it was a flash that almost burned the house down.

&amp;#x200B;

**Left Tackle**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Gary Zimmerman *(1993-1997)* \- Like several other players on this list, Zimmerman had already established himself as a top player at his position before joining the Broncos. The experience and talent that he brought to the team is one of the key factors that led to them finally winning a Super Bowl. It also led to 3 Pro Bowl appearances and being named 1st team All-Pro in 1996. He was responsible for protecting John Elway during the back nine of his career when any hit could potentially end his career, and he was a key cog in the ""block for Terrell Davis"" machine. The importance of both of those tasks cannot be understated, and Zimmerman never flinched in the face of those challenges.
2. Ryan Clady *(2008-2015)* \- Early on in his career, Clady was considered one of the best LTs in the NFL. He rarely committed penalties, allowed sacks at an even lower rate, and was stellar as both a pass protector and run blocker. He likely could have cemented himself as one of the greatest left tackles in NFL history if it wasn't for his career being marred by injuries. Despite his injuries, he still had some of the most impressive seasons in recent memory by a LT, including starting his career with a 20-game streak in which he never allowed a full sack.

&amp;#x200B;

**Left Guard**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Keith Bishop *(1980-1989)* \- Times were hard in Denver before their back-to-back championships in the late 90s. The legend of John Elway was diminishing with every blowout Super Bowl loss. However, that doesn't completely erase and invalidate the immense success they had leading up to those Super Bowls. A big reason for much of that success was the offensive line. Keith Bishop was a staple of that line, and has been credited by many as one of the top contributors to ""The Drive."" Bishop was selected to back-to-back Pro Bowls in 1986 and 1987.
2. Louis Vasquez *(2013-2015)* \- Short, sweet, and to the point. In 2 of his 3 seasons in Denver, the Broncos went to the Super Bowl. He only allowed 5.5 sacks in 3 full seasons, and was quietly very good on an offensive line that was inconsistent at best.

&amp;#x200B;

**Center**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tom Nalen *(1994-2007)* \- ""Alexa, play 'Like a Rock' by Bob Seger."" After his rookie season, Nalen was the starter at Center for 13 years. You couldn't ask for a more consistent, productive Center than what the Broncos got from Nalen. In those 13 seasons, the Broncos finished in the top 5 in rushing NINE times, and finished in the top 10 three other times. 11 of those seasons, the Broncos had a 1,000-yard rusher. He was a 5x Pro Bowler and was 1st-team All-Pro twice. The fact that this man has never so much as been a semifinalist for the Hall of Fame should be reported criminally.
2. Matt Paradis *(2014-2018)* \- As I watched the first snap of Super Bowl XLVIII sail over Peyton Manning's head, the first thought I had was ""Oh, shit. That's not good."" The second thought I had was ""We should probably draft a center next year."" Thankfully, John Elway apparently watched the same train wreck of a game that I did and felt the same way. Paradis was drafted and immediately made himself the piece we needed. Pro Football Focus regularly graded him as one of the top offensive linemen in the NFL during his 5 seasons in Denver, and he will be sorely missed.

&amp;#x200B;

**Right Guard**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mark Schlereth *(1995-2000)* \- Yet another staple of the 2x-champion offensive line, Schlereth was a pain in the ass for defensive linemen to deal with. Offensive linemen aren't usually known for their aggressiveness, and I bet none of them would willingly admit to peeing in their pads every week during the game like Schlereth did. He also apparently had a punch card with his surgeon, having had 29 surgeries during his career (20 on his knees alone). Side note: He is a member of the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame. I know this because that Hall of Fame is essentially located in the basement of the airport in Anchorage, Alaska, and I was lucky enough to visit it once.
2. Dan Neil *(1997-2004)* \- Talk about showing up at the right time. Neil was a rookie the year the Broncos won their first championship, but earned the starting role in his second season. From his first start until his last, Neil was as dependable as they come. Unfortunately, the bulk of his career was played during the most difficult transition the franchise had ever known, so his greatness wasn't as appreciated as it might have been otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

**Right Tackle**:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Ken Lanier *(1981-1992, 1994)* \- Along with Keith Bishop, Lanier was an impressively talented, rock solid O-lineman. His career isn't decorated with awards or accolades, and there's a fair to good chance that nobody outside of Denver would know who he is if you mentioned his name, but he was all you could ask for out of a tackle. He blocked well, he didn't commit egregious penalties, and didn't struggle with injuries (he had 9 full seasons out of the 11 he played in Denver after he earned the starting role).
2. Matt Lepsis *(1998-2007)* \- Often referred to as the second coming of Ken Lanier, Lepsis had an almost identical play style to his predecessor and was equally unrecognized. His career spanned the same unimpressive Broncos timeline that Dan Neil's did, so unfortunately people failed to recognize what the offensive linemen in that time were doing. Seemingly year after year, the Broncos would introduce a new face to the 1,000-yard rushing club, and that should be credited almost entirely to the offensive line that was blocking for them. Lepsis was as reliable as it gets.

&amp;#x200B;

**DEFENSE**:  

&amp;#x200B;

**Defensive End**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Elvis Dumervil *(2006-2012)* \- Ah, yes, the reason that I still hate fax machines. Dumervil was a promising young rookie who seemingly just got better as his career in Denver continued. In 6 seasons (he missed one due to a torn pectoral muscle), Dumervil racked up 63.5 sacks, 16 forced fumbles, 9 fumble recoveries, and the love of Broncos fans across the globe. He was a 3x Pro-Bowler and earned 1st-team All-Pro honors in his 4th season after posting 17.0 sacks and 4 FF's. Unfortunately, when it came time to re-sign Dumervil, a fax machine faux pas resulted in him leaving to join the Baltimore Ravens. If ""Doom"" was on the field, at any given moment you could expect some exciting defensive action, and his contribution to the team can't be oversold.  
2. Barney Chavous *(1973-1985)* \- Unfortunately, sacks were not a recorded stat untill 1982. But consider this: despite no ""official"" sacks until his 10th season, Chavous still has 23.0 for his career. As part of the legendary ""Orange Crush"" defense, he was a menace to opposing offenses and struck fear in opposing QBs. His trophy case at home might be a little empty (no Pro Bowl selections or championships), but it certainly wasn't for lack of effort or production.  
3. Rulon Jones *(1980-1988)* \- Jones was a model of consistency during his time in the NFL. He spent all 9 seasons of his career in Denver and was a hard hitter for all 9 of them. He finished his career 52.5 sacks, 23.5 of which came during a 2-year span from 1985-1986 when he earned 2 Pro Bowl selections and a 1st-team All-Pro selection.  
4. Derek Wolfe *(2012-Present)* \- While Wolfe doesn't have the flashiest numbers or the accolades, he certainly has the contribution factor. There isn't a measurable way to track the ""importance"" of a tackle or a sack, but Wolfe has always been able to make a play when it matters most. He played a large part in the Broncos having an all-time great defense in 2015 and continues to hold down his side of the defensive line whenever he's on the field.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Defensive Tackle**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rubin Carter *(1975-1986)* \- One of the greatest defensive players of his generation, Carter was also a pioneer of his position. He was one of the first Nose Tackles in the NFL and was criminally underrated during his playing career. In retrospect, sports analysts have looked back on his career with awe, but he was never selected to a Pro Bowl during his very impressive 12-year career. He was the face of the ""Orange Crush"" and was a major reason for the team reaching 5 AFC Championships and 3 Super Bowls during his career.
2. Trevor Pryce *(1997-2005)* \- Another ""good timing"" player who was drafted the year the Broncos won their first Super Bowl, Pryce was an absolute monster. He rotated back and forth between the defensive end and defensive tackle positions and was deadly no matter where he played. He amassed 64.0 sacks while with the Broncos, which currently places him at 4th on the all-time franchise sacks list. He was a 4x Pro-Bowler and a tackling machine.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Outside Linebacker**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Von Miller *(2011-Present)* \- Like there would be anybody else in this slot? Von Miller turned 30 just two days ago and is already the franchise's all-time sacks leader. Assuming he stays healthy and finishes his career in Denver, he will likely go down as the greatest defensive player in franchise history and has a good shot at cementing himself as one of the best defensive players in NFL history. No player currently in the NFL is more troublesome to opposing offenses than Miller, and his finesse moves have helped him swim through constantly being double-teamed (and occasionally even triple-teamed) by offensive linemen. He has posted double-digit sacks in all but one season of his career, and the one season he failed to was likely because he missed 7 games. He had an all-time great Super Bowl performance in SB 50, which earned him MVP honors. In just 8 seasons, he's already been selected to 7 Pro Bowls, earning 1st-team All-Pro honors 3 times. I don't think I'd be too hasty in saying that Von Miller is already a 1st-ballot Hall of Famer.   
2. Simon Fletcher *(1985-1995)* \- Fletcher owned the franchise's all-time sacks record for 23 years before Von came along. Regarded as one of the best defensive players in Broncos franchise history, he was a force to be reckoned with. During a 5-year stretch from 1989-1993, Fletcher stockpiled 66.0 sacks, yet somehow was never voted to a Pro Bowl. (""Hello, police, I'd like to report a robbery""). He was gravely important to the Broncos 3 Super Bowl appearances during his career, and while he will likely never be voted into the Hall of Fame, his legacy was recognized in 2016 when he was elected to the Broncos Ring of Fame.  
3. John Mobley *(1996-2003)* \- Where Miller and Fletcher presented themselves as threats to QBs by means of sacks and forced fumbles, Mobley was a threat to QBs after they managed to get the ball out. He was a cold-blooded killer in pass coverage, with as many career INTs as he had forced fumbles (5). He totaled 613 tackles (485 solo) in his career despite only playing 6 full seasons (he missed 14 games in 1999 and 8 in his final season). His deflection on Brett Favre's 4th &amp; 6 pass in Super Bowl XXXII was the nail in the coffin that sealed the deal for the Broncos' first championship.  
4. Tom Jackson *(1973-1986)* \- Jackson was another one of the anchors of the Orange Crush defense in the late 70s/early 80s. Sacks were not an officially recorded stat for the first 9 seasons of his career, but his 3 Pro Bowl selections and 1st-team All-Pro selection speak to his talent (especially in an era when many of the Broncos greats were being robbed of those selections).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Inside Linebacker**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Karl Mecklenburg *(1983-1994)* \- If you were to try to describe Mecklenburg in one word, I think it would have to be ""versatile"". He was regularly used at all 3 linebacker positions as well as the defensive line, and was a menace to society. During his 14 seasons in Denver, he racked up over 1,100 tackles, 79.0 sacks, 16 forced fumbles, 5 interceptions, 6 Pro Bowl selections, 3 first-team All-Pro selections, and a partridge in a pear tree. He's been a semi-finalist for the Hall of Fame 8 times, but unfortunately still remains on the outside. Mecklenburg is one of the best players ever to wear the orange &amp; blue, and it would be a real shame if he isn't elected in the near future.  
2. Randy Gradishar *(1974-1983)* \- Where Shannon Sharpe was known for his trash-talk and his instigating, Gradishar is his polar opposite in being one of the classiest players the organization has ever known. You'd never know that if all you ever saw was a highlight reel of Gradishar. He, too, played in a time of defensive stats not being officially recorded, but his unofficial numbers would show over 2,000 tackles during his storied career. He was elected to the Pro Bowl 7 times and was named 1st-team All-Pro twice. He was a huge contributor to the Orange Crush defense and a major factor in the Broncos' first Super Bowl berth in 1977.  
3. Bill Romanowski *(1996-2001)* \- Romanowski would place higher on this list if more of his oustanding career had been in Denver. But in just a few short years, he helped use his leadership and experience to guide the Broncos defense through their 2 Super Bowl championship runs. Those defenses have not been given the credit they are due, holding some of the more prolific offenses of the 1990s to a shockingly low point total. Romanowski deserves a significant portion of the credit for what he brought to the defense in those years, and was recognized with 2 Pro Bowl selections in his first 3 seasons in Denver. He also played in all 96 games in the 6 years there, an impressive feat for a player at such a physically taxing position.  
4. Al Wilson *(1999-2006)* \- Considering how few games Wilson missed in his 8 seasons, it was fairly disappointing to see his very productive career derailed by injuries so suddenly. He captained a defense that doesn't get enough attention for being as great as it was. He helped lead the Broncos to the AFC Championship in 2005 by shutting down opposing offenses. Wilson was extremely talented (earning 5 Pro Bowl nods and a 1st-team All-Pro selection), but his biggest contribution was his leadership. He knew how to fire up the men around him and was able to achieve some truly great feats (see my earlier comment about being the first team to hand Tom Brady a playoff loss). Despite an inconsistent offense that was still reeling from Elway's retirement, Wilson's defenses were consistently a difficult unit.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Safety**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Steve Atwater *(1989-1998)* \- The Smiling Assassin. The hit heard 'round the world. The greatest safety in franchise history (and heads up, it isn't even close). Steve Atwater should have been in the hall of fame 15 years ago, and his absence from Canton is inexcusable. I have never seen another player whose hits sparked fear in me as a viewer the way Atwater did, and I'm sure there are hundreds of NFL players who know that fear to a much higher degree than myself. He was selected to the Pro Bowl 7 consecutive times (8 total) and was named 1st-team All-Pro twice. He's a 2-time champion with over 1,100 hits and 24 INTs in his Broncos career, and as far as I'm concerned, he's a Hall of Famer.  
2. Dennis Smith *(1981-1994)* \- The 6 season stretch in which Smith and Atwater were on the field at the same time was one filled with sadness and literal headaches for their opponents. Smith played for 14 seasons in Denver, and they were 14 *quality* seasons. With 30 INTs, 17 fumble recoveries, and over 1,100 tackles, he was as dominant as they come. He was selected to 6 Pro Bowls and had 3 Super Bowl appearances.  
3. John Lynch *(2004-2007)* \- Lynch only spent his last 4 seasons with Denver after an impressive 11-year career with Tampa Bay, but you probably couldn't ask for more from a safety in his mid-30's than the Broncos got from him. He was a Pro Bowler all 4 seasons and looked as though he hadn't lost a step from his time as the commander of Tampa Bay's legendary defense. Fun fact, he forced more fumbles and recorded more sacks in Denver in 4 years (9 FF, 7.0 sacks) than he did in Tampa Bay in 11 years (7 FF, 6.0 sacks).  
4. Billy Thompson *(1969-1981)* \- A pioneer who paved the way for all of the safeties I listed before him. Despite playing safety, Thompson ranks 3rd on the franchise all-time interception list. He intercepted at least one pass in each of his 13 seasons, recorded 21 career fumble recoveries, and managed to take 7 of those turnovers to the house. He was shockingly consistent for a safety and was a 3-time Pro Bowler with a 1st-team All-Pro selection in 1977.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Cornerback**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Champ Bailey *(2004-2013)* \- I say this with confidence and dare anyone to fight me on it: Champ Bailey is the greatest cornerback of all-time. He was such a shutdown cornerback that opposing QBs were admittedly scared to throw his way. In the unlikely event that they would actually take that chance, the ball was either going to end up on the ground or in Bailey's hands. His 2006 season was the most dominant season by a CB ever. He recorded 10 INTs (with 1 TD) and only allowed 4 receptions all season. FOUR. That means that it was literally twice as likely that a QB's pass would be intercepted than completed if Bailey was covering his target. Over the course of his 10 year Broncos career, Champ totaled 34 INTs, 122 pass deflections, 522 solo tackles, and 3 defensive TDs. And next to Elway's helicopter dive, Champ Bailey's interception in the end zone against Tom Brady in the 2005 Divisional Playoffs is my favorite Broncos play of all-time. Oh, and he's also a Hall of Famer, 8x Pro-Bowler, and 3x 1st-team All-Pro selection.  
2. Chris Harris, Jr. *(2011-Present)* \- CHJ has quietly been one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL for most of his career. Although he's earned 4 Pro Bowl nods and been selected 1st-team All-Pro once in his 8 seasons, he's still extremely underrated considering his body of work. He's intercepted multiple passes every year since his second season and has logged 80 pass deflections total. He's been a wet blanket for just about every receiver he's been assigned to and, along with Aqib Talib and Bradley Roby, was part of the infamous No Fly Zone that was one of the best pass defenses in recent memory.  
3. Louis Wright *(1975-1986)* \- 5x Pro-Bowler and 2x 1st-team All-Pro Louis Wright was the hawk of the Orange Crush. He logged 26 INTs (1 returned for a TD) and 11 fumble recoveries in his career, and he was the first shutdown corner the Broncos ever had. Lou-Dini is a longtime member of the Broncos Ring of Fame, but has been largely ignored by the NFL Hall of Fame.  
4. Tyrone Braxton *(1987-1993, 1995-1999)* \- This was a tough spot, and I was back and forth between Braxton here versus Talib, but at the end of the day, I think Braxton earns this spot largely because of the difference in longevity with the team. Braxton spent all but 1 of his 13-year career in Denver and was a member of 4 Super Bowl teams, 2 of them championship teams. He was only selected to the Pro Bowl once, but it was in a year in which he led the league in INTs with 9. Braxton was also a hybrid defensive back, making nearly half of his career starts at Safety.  
5. Aqib Talib *(2014-2017)* \- While Talib only spent 4 seasons in Denver, he sure made the best of his time there. His 11 interceptions in that time is impressive enough, but the fact that he returned 6 of them for TDs is downright bonkers. He was a Pro-Bowler all 4 seasons and was a 1st-team All-Pro in 2016. He and Chris Harris, Jr. were an unstoppable duo with two wildly different skill sets, but Talib's penchant for nabbing other QB's passes lands him confidently on this list. He was also one of the Big 4 free agents signed in 2014 (Talib, Ware, Sanders, Ward) that were largely responsible for bringing Denver their third championship in Super Bowl 50.  
6. Ray Crockett *(1994-2000)* \- Crockett was as dependable as they come. He played in all but 6 games during his 7-year tenure with the Broncos and hauled in 17 INTs during that time. He could always be counted on to prevent a big offensive play from happening and made a lot of key plays during their two Super Bowl runs. While he never earned any Pro Bowl selections, he was a major contributor for the team when they needed him most.  

&amp;#x200B;

**SPECIAL TEAMS**:  

&amp;#x200B;

**Kicker**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Jason Elam *(1993-2007)* \- If more kickers were elected to the Hall of Fame (there are only 3), Elam would be a lock. For 15 years, Jason Elam was rock solid in a position that isn't given the credit it's due. He made all but 3 of his 604 extra point attempts and converted over 80% of his field goal attempts. He had a hell of a foot, too. He had 37 FGs of 50 yards or more, including a record-tying 63 yard field goal in 1998 (one of his 3 Pro Bowl seasons).  

&amp;#x200B;

**Punter**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Tom Rouen *(1993-2001)* \- Unfortunately there isn't really much to say here except that Rouen was a solid punter with the most punting yardage in Broncos history (681 punts for 28,146 yards, an average of 41.3 yards per punt). He also was a member of both Super Bowl championship teams in 1997 and 1998.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Long Snapper**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Casey Kreiter *(2016-Present)* \- How did I base my decision for this one, you ask? In 2018, Kreiter became the first Broncos long snapper to be elected to the Pro Bowl. Good enough for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Coach**:  

&amp;#x200B;

1. Mike Shanahan *(1995-2008)* \- When you're the first coach to bring a franchise to the promised land, you almost win this slot by default. However, Shanahan is also the winningest coach in Broncos history, showcased by a 3-year span from 1996-1998 in which the Broncos won 46 total games, a record at the time.

Kaeps career would’ve been waaaaay different and maybe P-Willis would’ve played a bit longer (long shot).

So earlier I was watching highlights on Drew Lock with how he has been a riser coming closer to the draft. One thing I noticed that stuck out to me like a sore thumb and I dont know if it's just me but he looks so unnatural throwing and sitting in the pocket. He almost has an off balanced look when he is small stepping in the pocket. When he throws it, it almost looks painful. Again i dont know if it's just me but what is everyone's thoughts on this?"

[3-Tech](http://insidethepylon.com/football-101/glossary-football-101/2015/08/31/itp-glossary-3-technique/)


Honestly, the first graphic in both links can help a lot of newer NFL fans understand the battle in the trenches a lot better. And while the video examples are a little older, they still show good examples of what a DT lining in the 1-Tech or 3-Tech is meant to accomplish.

It's also kinda like the home run race in 1998, where Sosa beat Maris's record with 66, only to have McGwire top that with 70 of his own.

* Signed WR Damiere Byrd to a 1 year contract 

**Green Bay Packers**

* WR Jordy Nelson announced his retirement 

**Player History**

**Damiere Byrd**

* From Erial, New Jersey. Erial is an unincorporated territory, but the local school recently won the 2016 South Jersey Shore Group IV State sectional championship off a 12-0 season 

* Attended the University of South Carolina and was known for his blazing speed while also participating on the track team. During the 2015 NFL Combine, he put up the quickest three-cone drill (6.6 seconds) and the 60 yard shuttle (10.90 seconds)

* He was signed by the Panthers as a UDFA and spent his rookie season on the practice squad in 2015. In 2016, he made the active roster but remained inactive  until being placed on the practice squad until December. In 2017, he was placed on IR after suffering a broken arm. He was later activated and returned a franchise record 103 yard kickoff. He injured his leg and was put back on IR. He played in 8 games in 2018, primarily as a punt returner before hitting the IR. 

* Career Statistics include 12 receptions, 129 yards, 355 return yards, 3 total TDs

* [Highlights](https://youtu.be/hxH3bpUOLiQ)

**Jordy Nelson**

* From Manhattan, Kansas. Known as the “Little Apple”, Manhattan is also home to Kansas State University and is also the sister city of Dobrichovice, Czech Republic. Nelson also grew up on a family farm that was established by his great-great-grandfather who immigrated from Sweden. I’d say this would make Nelson a Viking, but I don’t wanna ruffle any feathers 

* Nelson Attended Kansas State, initially as a walk on, but ended his college career with All-America honors and was a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, which was awarded to Michael Crabtree. He ended his college career with 206 receptions for 2,822 yards and 20 TDs. 

* Nelson was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the 2nd round of the 2008 NFL Draft, one of two Wildcats selected and the third receiver taken behind Donnie Avery and Devin Thomas. Nelson proved to be a valuable asset to the team, making play after play and being a major reason the team won Super Bowl XLV. 

* Thanks to his impressive performance, Green Bay resigned Nelson in 2011 for a 3 year extension. To thank Green Bay for giving him that green money, Nelson decided to put up career highs in receptions (68), yards (1,263), and TDs (15). After missing some time in 2012 due to injury, Nelson decided to prove injuries are for squared by putting up new career high numbers in receptions (85) and yards (1,314) in 2014. He only didn’t set a new high in TDs so other receivers can score to, thus boosting morale. 

* After once again showing he deserves it, Nelson got a new contract extension from Green Bay, a 4 year, $39M contract. So obviously he sets a career high 209 yards in a game during a week 2 contest with the Jets. This made him the first Packer to have a 200 yard game since Javon Walker in 2004. This huge game helped him set a new career, and a franchise record in receiving yards (1,519). In 2015 he tore his ACL in good faith to give NFC North defenders a break. Seriously, what a nice guy. But his kindness didn’t last long as he was 2016’s NFL Comeback Player of the Year with a strong performance. 

* After a poor 2017 season, compared to his other seasons, Green Bay Released Nelson and he was signed the Oakland Raiders. This would be his lone season with the team as he was released after the 2018 season 

* Career statistics include 613 receptions for 8,587 yards, and 72 TDs. He is also a Super Bowl XLV Champion, Pro Bowler (2014), Second team All-Pro (2014), NFL Comeback Player of the Year (2016), Best Comeback Athlete Espy Award (2017), NFL Receiving Touchdowns Award (2016), All-American (2007), First Team All-Big12 (2007).

This team is super stacked.  It not so much the starters (although they’re great) it’s the depth this team has especially on defense.  Almost every starter is backed by a great player.  The receivers aren’t amazing and QB play may be an issue but with two HOF tackles they would have all day to wait for Tony Gonzales to get open.


Tampa Bay and Baltimore have had two to three really great drafts in a row.  And even though Denver only had 3 picks this draft 2 of those players made this team and they also added an undrafted guy make this team.  You can really see these team setting up for their Super Bowl runs.


Also Mike Vrabel is sexy as hell.  Dude was the sexiest man on the Patriots before he retired bar none.

With today being Opening Day in the MLB, I thought to do the opposite. What is the best football team we can make with names of players who played baseball?

To make this list, I went onto pro-football-reference and sorted every position by Career AV, and then typed each name into the search bar of baseball-reference until I found a MLB player of the same name. First games were given leniency (like if the football players name was Jon but the baseball counterpart was John) but last names had to be exact. Unlike the baseball version of my post where I created a whole team, I’m only putting in starters because I’m not making a whole 53 man roster. I’m providing a link to every baseball player 

Onto the team:

QB: Terry Bradshaw: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/bradste01.shtml 

Bradshaw might be considered overrated by many, but by AV he just edges out Jim Hart and Jim Kelly. The baseball Terry Bradshaw is a Cardinals outfielder who was called up several times in mid 1990’s but only played in 34 career games

RB: Jim Brown: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brownji03.shtml

By AV, Jim Brown isn’t the best RB of all time, but that’s only because the first three years of his career isn’t counted by AV. Luckily, he’s the first with a generic enough name to share with a baseball player. In fact, there’s been two Jim Browns, but the best James Brown went by the name of Jimmy, an infielder mostly for the Cardinals who made an All-Star game in 1942.

RB: Fred Taylor: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/t/taylofr01.shtml  

For our backup running back, The OG Jaguars back has a slot, sharing a name with a seldom used Senator’s first basemen in the 1950’s who has a career negative WAR.

WR: James Lofton: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/loftoja01.shtml 

James Lofton is, in my biased opinion, one of the most underrated wideouts of all time, and AV supports my claim, giving him eighth all time in WR AV and first among wideouts who share a names with a baseball player. I can’t say the same for the James Lofton who played for the Red Sox in 2001, who racked up negative WAR for Boston in 2001 in his only 8 games in the majors.

WR: Chris Carter: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/cartech02.shtml 

The first currently active MLB player on our list shows up in Chris Carter, a powerful first basemen who lead the NL in home runs with the Brewers in 2016 but isn’t on a team now due to being bad at everything else. His NFL counterpart is quite the contrary, the Minnesota wideout was the rock of the Vikings for more than a decade.

WR: Jimmy (James) Smith: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smithji01.shtml 

The Jaguars somehow get their second player on this team by having a really generic name be very, very good for them. There’s two James Smith, the longest lasting one bouncing around the NL in the late teens as a very bad player.

TE: Tony Gonzalez https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/g/gonzato01.shtml  

The leader in Tight ends by AV and a figure many say is the best of all time at the position, Tony Gonzalez also shares a name with a Cuban outfielder. The baseball Gonzalez played mostly for the Phillies and played well enough to gather MVP votes in three different years in the 1960s.

LT: Mike Wilson https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/wilsomi02.shtml 

The tip-tier linemen are kind of lackluster when it comes to baseball sharing names. For our LT, we’re taking a guy who was never the best tackle on his own team. Mike Wilson was a solid starting O-Linemen for the Bengals but of course was overshadowed by Anthony Munoz. And while Wilson never received any accolades, he was a solid starter on some very good Bengals teams in the 80’s, and while he played mostly RT, he started his career on the left side, so we’ll slot him here on our all-time team. Baseball-wise, there have been two Mike Wilson’s, even though neither of them have played more than 8 games

LG: Ray Brown: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brownra01.shtml 

Ray Brown mostly racked up his AV through longevity, starting games at the age of 42 and making his lone Pro Bowl appearance at age 39 with the 49ers in 2001. He played both sides of the line, though here he’ll be our starting left guard. The baseball Ray Brown is the exact opposite, pitching just once for the Cubs in 1909, giving up two earned runs in a win.

C: Jon (John) Morris: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/morrijo06.shtml 

The best center who shares his name with a baseball player is Jon Morris, a center primarily for the Patriots who made several Pro Bowls in the AFL and once in the post-merger era. There are a couple John Morris’s in baseball, the best being a reliever for several teams in the late 60’s and early 70’s.

RG: Ed White: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/w/whiteed01.shtml 

Another non-Hall of Famer makes our offensive line. Ed White was a several time Pro Bowler for the Vikings and the Chargers in the 70’s and early 80’s. Whereas Brown made his lone Pro Bowl on the left side, all of White’s six Pro Bowls were on the right, so we’ll slot him here. But much like Brown, the baseball Ed White played minimally, getting just five plate appearances in three games with the White Sox in 1955

RT:  Bob Brown: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brownbo03.shtml 

Our only Hall of Famer on the line, Bob Brown made Pro Bowls for the Eagles, Rams, and Raiders and was on five All-Pro Teams in the late 60’s and early 70’s. His baseball counterparts were similarly more successful, of the four Robert Browns, three played more than five years and one won four rings with the Yankees in the 40’s


DEFENSE

DE: Jim Marshall: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/marshji01.shtml 

Running the wrong way on a fumble doesn’t count against AV like it does in Hall of Fame voting, so Jim Marshall easily finds his way onto the list. His baseball counterpart was also relatively successful compared to others on this team, Marshall played four years as a first baseman and outfielder on five different teams in the late 50’s and early 60’s.

DT: Fred Miller: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/millefr01.shtml 

We’re running a 4-3 cause the our ends and linebackers ran that system and the MLB aren’t that good, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that our DT’s are the cream of the crop either. And yes, while Fred Miller did make three Pro Bowls for the Colts in the late 60’s, he certainly doesn’t compare to Jim Marshall, no offense to Fred. The baseball Fred Miller pitched in just 6 games in 1910, but he played so here he is.

DT: Walter Johnson: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/J/JohnWa00.htm 

The first player whose baseball counterpart is better. The NFL’s Walter Johnson was a three time pro bowler for the Browns in the 60’s and 70’s, but he’s got nothing on the Hall of Fame Senators ace who holds an untouchable record of 110 career shutout and is often labeled as the best right hand starting pitcher of all time. Just don’t ask him to run for Congress

DE: Deacon Jones: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/jonesde01.shtml

Our second defensive end’s first name is David, but somehow there’s been more Deacon Jones in the MLB than there’s been David Jones. The head-slapping behemoth shares his name with two players, and while WAR gives the edge to the younger, the Deacon I’ve linked here IMO is better, a pitcher for the Tigers in the dead-ball era (actually mostly cause we don’t have any pitchers on our team). This dude’s full name was Carroll Elmer Jones, so I can see why he goes by Deacon instead

OLB: Dave Robinson: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/robinda01.shtml 

Our first outside linebacker was one of the many members of the Lombardi Packers to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. Robinson made three Pro Bowls and was an All-Pro in the 1967 season. His baseball counterpart was an outfielder for the Padres in the early 70’s, logging under 50 PA.

MLB: Pepper (Thomas) Johnson: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnsto02.shtml 

Pepper Johnson is most known for playing in the 3-4 system with the Giants in their Super Bowl runs in the late 80’s and early 90’s, but he seamlessly moved to a 4-3 MLB with Belichick’s Browns and made a Pro Bowl there as well. Pepper’s first name was Thomas, which he shares with a Twins relief pitcher from the mid 70’s. Tom Johnson was good enough to fetch MVP votes in 1977 with a 16-7 record and a 3.13 ERA

OLB: Clay (William) Matthews: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/matthwi01.shtml 

While I’d love this defense to have it’s linebacking crew flanked by two Packers, Thor’s dad has the better career by AV. Clay II made four Pro Bowls with the Browns in the late 80’s and played into his 40’s with the Falcons. Of course Clay isn’t their first name, it’s William. There has been just one player named William Matthews, a pitcher for the Red Sox in 1909.

CB: Deion Sanders: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/sandede02.shtml 

Deion might be only the seventh best CB by Approximate Value, but he is by far the best player who played in both leagues. The player who some regard as the best cover corner of all time also played nine MLB seasons, making no all star games but did lead the NL in triples in 1992.

FS: Bobby (Bob) Boyd: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/boydbo01.shtml 

Prominent free safeties who share their names with baseball players are few and far between, so we’re going to slot another corner to this position to make this team. Bobby Boyd was a three time All-Pro for the Colts in the 1960’s. The baseball Bob Boyd was a negro league player who became the first black White Sox player in 1951 at the age of 31, although his best years were with the Orioles in the late 50’s.

SS: Dick (Rick) Anderson: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/a/anderri02.shtml 

We are going to take a proper strong safety, and a damn good one in Dick Anderson. One of the best members of the No-Name Defense, Anderson was twice an All Pro and was the DPOY in 1973. While there isn’t any Dick Anderson’s, there were two Rick Anderson. The baseball player I linked was a relief pitcher for the Mets and Royals in the late 80’s

CB: Willie (William) Brown: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/brownwi01.shtml 

Our second corner comes in the form of Willie Brown, a HOF corner for the Raiders and Broncos in the late 60’s and 70’s. There are two William Browns in the baseball world, the best being a first baseman, catcher, and outfieder for several teams, most notably the Giants in the late 1880’s.

CB: Jimmy (Jim) Johnson: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/j/johnsji04.shtml 

Our slot corner is not the former Cowboys coach and current Fox analyst, but another Hall of Famer who played with the 49ers in the 60’s and 70’s. I’m gonna take a quick detour to talk about why Jimmy Johnson was so great and why he was so underrated. San Francisco PR people had to pioneer new statistics to explain how good he was, since most sportswriters who voted on awards didn’t watch his games out west and relied mostly on interceptions numbers, which he didn’t have since quarterbacks didn’t throw to him. The Niners started looking at game averages, and over a two year stretch, Johnson’s receivers averaged 2 catches for 23 yards a game. There’s a reason he seemingly came out of nowhere to make four straight All Pro teams. Back to our objective; there have been two Jim Johnsons in baseball, including our second active player, a relief pitcher who made an All Star Game with the Orioles in 2012 and currently pitches for the Angels

K: Eddie Murray: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/murraed02.shtml 

Our kicker on this team is the second instance of the baseball player being better than the football player. The kicker Eddie Murray made two Pro Bowls with the Lions in the 80’s and played into the 2000’s for the Redskins. The first basemen Eddie Murray made eight All Star games with the Orioles and Dodgers, finished second in MVP voting twice, and is the all time leader in sacrifice flies.

P: Tommy Davis: https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/d/davisto02.shtml 

Tommy Davis, the premier punter in the league in the 60’s with the 49ers, rounds out our team, He shares his name with two players, the best being an outfielder for several teams, most notably the Dodgers in the 60’s. The baseball Davis made two All star teams, lead the league in batting average twice, and almost won the MVP in 1962 as the league leader in hits and RBI’s

Lastly, I’d like to give a shoutout to Steve Smyth (https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/smythst01.shtml), whose Y prevented Steve Smith from being one of our wideouts, and Cal Hubbard, who is in the Baseball Hall of Fame as an ump but because he didn’t play for a team (and also because he played in the NFL before AV could be calculated), the Hall of Fame lineman didn’t make the team either

This isn't about crowning Lamar Jackson a future franchise quarterback. There aren't enough attempts for a conclusion like that. This is about the accusation that he can't throw the football - I'm just not seeing any numerical support for an accusation like that.


What am I missing in these numbers that make Lamar Jackson a bad passer? Why are Rosen/Allen/Darnold considered effective passers with inferior statistics while Jackson is sometimes called the next Tim Tebow?"

271,"the jordan howard trade sucks i know, but it’s the right decision for both teams",74,0,0,nfl,"A comprehensive analysis on why the J How trade was good for both sides.

    2 mil
on 2019 draft contract pay scale, jordan howard would have had to have been picked at #27 to match his salary of roughly 2 million dollars. (spotrac, https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/draft/ ) the “value” of the fifth-round contract has dried up by now, as the thought is that a player drafted that late must be worth more to still be on the team than a younger player.


    comp pick fa comparisons- all from spotrac, https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/rankings/cap-hit/running-back/

leonard fournette makes 7.4 mil, and is perceived as a better (or at least higher ceiling), but similar howard, but is also thought to be overpaid due to his slight overdraft. melvin gordon makes 5.6. similar-caliber rb in the league, but without consistent drop-off over his 3 seasons, regardless of scheme influence. melvin ingram makes 3.3. highest would be 7.4 mil, realistic would be around 4-5 mil. so, yes. the eagles Will be getting an underutilized player who will fill for a year at 3 mil under market value. For a 6th round pick, even if it doesn’t pan out they haven’t expended too much. A 6th hardly ever pans out anyway. And if it goes well and he way over performs, maybe raising his expected market value to 6 or 7 mil? Then yeah, we’ll give a fifth. We’re a super bowl contender and a good running back for cheap will be considered a brilliant move by Roseman, as it really is.

    down to the dirty work in this though, for the bears:

next year they figure to have these fa’s leaving, along with their expected salaries on next contract, if any- 
3 mil- chase daniel, maybe 3 mil. won’t get a contract at 5 mil if it’s not from the bears, and they won’t figure to keep him another year past this due to a tight cap and his age
650k- taquan mizzel. only next year if it doesn’t happen sooner. 
650k- marvin hall
650k- Zach Miller, everyone knows his story. he won’t get another contract but i’ll put him in anyway.
1.5 mil- bradley sowell, one year older. ok depth. he’ll find a spot.
~~4-5 mil- cody whitehair- good center, starts slow every year but still good young talent. he’ll probably be re-signed by the bears, so ill cross him off
650k, ted larsen, g. depth depth depth.
650k, cornelius lucas, rt. depth again
~~1 mil, coward, he’ll be re-signed. he’s been a good project piece.
1 mil, jonathan bullard. former 2nd or 3rd rounder so he’ll get another chance, but just never really flashed when he had the chances.
650k, nick williams, dl depth
~~1.5-3 mil, RRH. good young piece that’s really started to flash. prolly be re-signed.
~~5 mil, danny t. good, getting older, but he should stick around a bit longer to pair with roquan and help him into his prime.
~~5-7 mil, leonard floyd. extension guaranteed already.
2 mil, kwit, maybe we re-sign, who knows. fine lb depth.
650k, irving. lb depth
5-8 mil, haha, if he goes off he could make bank. i’ll go up to 8 mil.
1.5 mil, mcmanis. we might bring him back idk. 1.5 mil added to the leaving list just for the sake of this list.
1 mil, deon bush. depth.

this totals out to 22.55 million dollars exiting our payroll next year (https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/chicago-bears/yearly/cap/).

add in jordan howard’s say, 5 mil salary in 2020, we would be at an easy 27.5 mil.

on average, teams have spent 33.2 million in fa so far in 2019 (per spotrac, https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/tools/offseason/). many would argue this is unfair to the bears due to their tight cap situation, and to adjust the bears expected spending next year down as such, but as of now the bears are the 15th most cap-flexible team in the nfl. if i were to adjust to match cap, it would only hurt the bears argument.

that bears argument is this: jordan howard Would Have netted us a comp pick of 6th-round value or higher, because that is the threshold of the value being higher to keep him than trade him.

but as i have above proven, we would not have lost more than we spent in next years fa, even with jordan counting towards our formula. we don’t have many splash players hitting fa next year, and it was a safe bet that we wouldn’t have gotten a comp pick for jordan howard at all.

    jordan howard’s rushing just was not as effective this year. 

i will address the end of season up-swing that coincided with the zone scheme change. but first, his rushing average was 3.7 on the year (https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2018/rushing.htm). that sandwiched him in with alfred morris, david johnson, and peyton barber. not very good. but, accounting for scheme change, his average was 4.52 (http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/gamelog/_/id/3060022/jordan-howard). that sandwiches him directly between sony michelle and kenyon drake. better company, for sure, but not elite. no way about it, it wasn’t elite. and that’s a problem for his value in nagy’s offense. his value as an elite yard-chewer back would be irreplaceable, but at just-good his inability to be more of a pass threat or home-run hitter in this offense is a big problem. it’s not that he can’t be used, it’s that his forced use because he is good and does deserve touches, limits the offense. they Must use him, or at least try, and he’s limiting this offense’s potential to be multi-dimensional across the board.

    in the right offense, jordan howard can still be a great piece. he IS A VERY GOOD RUNNER.

the eagles are getting something similar to the role they had jay ajayi and legarrette blount fill. probably even better, if what they want is a guy that will find every hole and 5-10 yards he can behind a solid o-line. he will do that amazingly well. you can ride him with a shitload of carries against huge stacked boxes and he’ll fight through anything to find the hole and run straight through the first person that hits them. he’ll be hard-pressed to get more than 20 yards very often, but he genuinely is good. great, even, in the right system. he will be sorely missed in chicago. he was the only player worth watching on that bears team for a short while with Fox, and he will always be loved. The true bears fans will point to his name in the bears record books decades from now and say, man he was a really great way to kick off a dynasty. it hurt to see him go and miss out on his hard work, but we will forever be grateful for his time put in.


we all miss j how. he embodies being a bear in so many ways it’s silly. but strictly business-wise, it was probably the better decision to trade him.
we all wish j how the best. he deserves success, all the way till the nfc championship game of course when we’ll have to beat him every year. 
we all need to begin to accept this trade, and while mourning is fine, meanness is not. we’re still bears fans no matter what.
be prepared to get meme’d and roasted for the trade in r/nfl. we had our time after the mack trade, and now it’s come full circle. some will be reasonable, many will not. it’s fine to share facts, but not to incite.


we wish you the best j how, thanks for it all

Kliff Kingsbury has a very interesting decision to make which could potentially alter 3 franchises. Now I have a slightly different point of view that I wanted to share. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is two different sides to this whole ordeal. 

There is the camp which says that Rosen was put in a god awful position last year and it is impossible to judge him based on last year. Thus, it would be foolish to trade such a talented young QB after investing the #10 pick on him when all you are going to get is (most likely) a second rounder.  Lets call this the Rosen camp

Next is the camp that says that Rosen did not show enough last year. This camp says that if you're a true franchise QB, you should be able to perform, and at least show flashes through out the year, which Rosen did not show. No excuse for being the worst team in the league. So, they must move on and draft Kyler Murray. An exciting new QB. Let's call this the Murray camp

Which camp are you on? 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my belief is a mix of both. As a huge college football fan, and one that followed Rosen from highschool before he even committed to UCLA (guy was a superstar in HS), I thought Rosen was the best qb in the draft last year and I 100% agree that one year under such awful situation is no basis for trading such talented player. Most NFL scouts/experts say that his evaluation is identical now to last year. Just look at the Rams &amp; Goff. People wrote BUST all over after his first year with Jeff Fisher but the past season, he was in the MVP conversation. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here is where it gets interesting. Anyone that follows college ball knows that Kliff Kingsbury is an......lets be real, huge risk of a hire. This is like hiring Chip Kelly times 10,000. He was literally fired last year at Texas Tech, now he is supposed to lead an NFL franchise? Cardinals hired him for one reason and one reason only. His god damn air raid offense. Which is the most beautiful and the most bizarre thing to watch. The chances of him succeeding is very low. Think about other college offensive minded coaches that got hired in the promise of ""revolutionizing the modern NFL offense"". From Spurrier to Chip Kelly, they all fell one by one. 

Kliff isn't stupid. He know this. For his offense to work in the NFL, everything needs to be PERFECT. And in his system, it all starts with the QB. His system relies on a mobile QB that can sling it all over. Now I am NOT saying Rosen wold not work. He can move if needed and most importantly, he can make the throws and at the end of the day, no matter the system, that's all that matters. 

But this means that Rosen would not be fully utilized to his potential (at least in my opinion) because he is the ideal pocket passer. While it obviously wouldn't fully utilize Kliff's mobile, back yard style football. But you know who fits literally perfectly to Kliff's offense? Murray. 

Now let's look at Murray. God this kid is fun to watch. His got an arm, he is a threat to take it to the house on any runs. He is unlike anything NFL has ever seen. If Kaepernick and Russell wilson had a baby, it would be Murray. But as we all know, he is undersized and is from the Oklohoma Offense which also runs a spread (not quite air raid but) air assault. He is a huge risk. 

&amp;#x200B;

In my opinion, Kyler Murray's chances of succeding in the NFL is lower than Rosen's. Meanwhile I see Kliff's chances of succeeding as even lower. Both these guys need the perfect situation to succeed. And I think Kliff knows this. If you match Murray and Kliff together, I believe this is the ideal situation for BOTH parties. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:

So it isn't that Rosen is bad. I believe that in 99.99% scenarios, no NFL team should trade away such a talented young QB. But this isn't a normal situation. For Kliff to have a chance at succeeding in the NFL, he knows Kyler is his best bet and thus, Kyler Murray wlll be drafted #1 overall "

This team may not have the best QB’s but this offensive line should be able to give the QB’s plenty of time to through it up to two different HOFers and other amazing Receivers.


This draft is like the 1983 draft for Wide Receivers there were just so many good receivers that got drafted.  Unfortunately that meant several really good receivers were left off of this team.  The most notable receivers excluded were, Amani Toomer, Terry Glenn, Eddie Kennison, and Bobby Engram.

 
This draft also was great for Linebackers.  Unfortunately, most of them were middle linebackers so a lot of the linebackers on this team would be playing out of position if this team were real.

337,32 All-Time Teams in 32 Days: Cincinnati Bengals,10,29,0,nfl,"History

Though they played their first game in 1968, the real history of the Cincinnati Bengals began in 1963 when legendary head coach, Paul Brown was fired from the Cleveland Browns. By 1966, the governor of Ohio convinced Paul Brown that the stated needed a second team.  The city of Cincinnati was chosen and the team was named the Bengals as an homage to Cincinnati’s previous professional football that existed from 1937 to 1942.

Paul Brown was forced to join the AFL as the NFL required stadium capacity to be at least 50,000 and Cincinnati’s largest football venue at that time was the University of Cincinnati’s Nippert Stadium, which could only hold 28,000.  With the impending merger of the AFL and NFL, the Bengals would only be permitted to join the NFL if a new stadium was created by the 1970 merger; this was achieved when the Cincinnati city council and Hamilton County agreed to build Riverfront Stadium to house both the Bengals and Major League Baseball’s Reds.

The Cincinnati Bengals played their first game, coached by Brown, on September 6th, 1968; losing in San Diego by a score of 29-13.  The next week, the Bengals hosted their first home game and achieved their first franchise by beating the Denver Broncos, 24-10.  The Bengals finished that first season with a 3-11 record and slightly improved the next season with a 4-9-1 record.  In the first season of the NFL/AFL merger, the Bengals achieved their first winning season with an 8-6 record; clinching the AFC Central title.  The Bengals were eliminated from the playoffs in the Divisional Round after being shut out by the Baltimore Colts 17-0.

Paul Brown would coach the Bengals through the 1975 season before moving to the front office, making the playoffs two more times but failing to win the franchise’s first playoff game.  After Paul Brown’s retirement, the Bengals would fail to make the playoffs for the rest of the decade. Forrest Gregg was named head coach in 1980 and by his second season had guided the team to a 12-4 record and a division title.  The Bengals would go to win the AFC conference championship by beating the San Diego Chargers 27-7, in the infamous “Freezer Bowl” which had a game time temperature of -37 degrees factoring in the wind chill.  The Bengals would eventually lose in Super Bowl XVI to the San Francisco 49ers, led by Bill Walsh and Joe Montana.

The Bengals would make the playoffs one more time under Gregg before Sam Wyche became head coach in 1984. Several years would pass before the team would return to the playoffs but following a 4-11 season in 1987, Cincinnati once again won the AFC Central title with a 12-4 record during the 1988 season. The Bengals returned to the Super Bowl that year in a rematch against the 49ers but were stunned by Joe Montana in one of the greatest drives in Super Bowl history.  

Two seasons later would mark the last time that Cincinnati would make the playoffs for 15 years and is currently the last time the Bengals would win a playoff game.  After a decade of being one of the worst teams in the NFL, Cincinnati would hire Marvin Lewis in 2003 and eventually winning their first AFC North title three years later.  Cincinnati would make the playoffs six times over the next 13 seasons as Marvin Lewis would go on to be the franchise leader in wins.  

Following a last place finish in 2018, Marvin Lewis was let go and a new era for the franchise would begin under the leadership of new head coach Zac Taylor.

""A lot of Brady's misses came when he was forced to move on from his first read, though those accounted for only 9% of his attempts, per PFF.""

That is mindblowing. 9%!! 

How is that possible?

Of all teams the pats' adjustments fall the least on the QB out of any team I can think.

A lot of the route adjustments happen on the fly by the receivers.

For example edelman can have the option of in/out/hitch based on the alignment of the guy covering him. Inside leverage, he goes out. Outside leverage he goes in. Gap in the zone, he sits in it.

Brady may motion a guy to see if it is man or zone and change the play but there is no way for him to know what kind of leverage the DB will take post snap.

In other systems the route is the route. If the play says run an in route at 15 yards that is what the receiver runs. It does not matter if tge DB takes inside leverage and the route is doomed. The route gets run. This forces the QB to move on to his 2nd read.

For Brady that is not the case. If that 15 yard in route is doomed the recveiver runs an out route instead. This is why NE's primary routes are open at a remarkable rate."
379,"[OC] How concerning is it if a QB has a bad game in their final season of college? Why ""9 points scored"" is a magic number for draft-eligible QBs",241,1095,1,nfl,"Every year, I ask the question of whether or not there’s a way to weed out prospects of the NFL Draft based on a magic number. This is a number that, while not guaranteeing success, is designed to all but guarantee someone’s failure in the league. And I’ve done this in the past few years. It started with [the 58.5% magic number for QBs](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/65zs0w/oc_why_585_is_the_magic_number_for_qbs_in_the_nfl/?st=jtonn9nz&amp;sh=406c7528), which states that any QB that completed 58.5% of their passes or less, then their odds of succeeding in the NFL were fairly slim. I did it last year with [QBs that averaged 7.3 yards per attempt or less](https://en.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/87hr26/oc_why_73_ypa_is_the_magic_number_for_qbs_in_the/?st=jtonofkc&amp;sh=5e48ec87), which states that any QB that fell below this threshold had a slim chance of succeeding in the NFL.

This year, I’m continuing on that analysis, and I’ve found some magic numbers not just for QBs, but this year, for wide receivers. The goal is to do one post a week, every Tuesday morning leading up to the draft, where I break down one of these numbers. And the premise for this one is bad games.

As Daniel Powter once said, [“you had a bad day.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH476CxJxfg). As Hannah Montana once said, [“everybody makes mistakes”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t93u0qg5q_M), and nobody’s perfect. To expect a QB to be great for every single game in college is somewhat unreasonable. Obviously, if a QB has a bunch of bad games, odds are, they’re just bad. Tom Jackson always said on NFL Primetime that once is an accident, twice is a trend, and three times is a problem.

But what if a QB has a game that’s so horribly bad? What about a QB having a game where the offense is unable to score anything, and a game where the offense gets held without a touchdown? Is that a sign for concern in the NFL? That’s what this magic number is going to be taking a look at.

**Part I: The Formula**

I looked at every QB to get drafted since the 2001 NFL Draft. Why did I set the cutoff at this date? It wasn’t because of some arbitrary cutoff or because there was a guy in 2000 that disproved this point completely. It was because College Reference (which is what I used for game logs of these quarterbacks) does not have any game logs for college prior to the 2000 season. This means I have no way of knowing if a QB played in that game or not; maybe they were hurt or suspended. 

As an example to prove this point, in 2009, Oklahoma had a game against Nebraska where they lost 10-3. However, I know that Sam Bradford didn’t play in that game, because he was injured for practically that entire season, and [his game log does not show that game](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/sam-bradford-1/gamelog/2009/). If this game took place in 1999 and not 2009, however, I would have no idea of whether or not he played. I tried going beyond this and finding game logs of quarterbacks from other websites from prior to 2000, but the data was spotty at best. However, there is a fairly large sample size here, so this shouldn’t be too much of an issue.

With all of that being said, the number that I settled upon was 9 points. Simply put, **if a team scored 9 points or less in a game against an unranked opponent**, I took a look at the QB and put them on the list. If this occurred, then in all likelihood, that QB will not be good in the NFL.

I took a look at a few things when creating the list:

- I only took a look at a QB during their final season in college. If a QB’s team had a stinker of a game when that QB was a junior, but didn’t have one as a senior, then I didn’t take a look at it. It had to be that player’s final season

- The QB had to start the game. I’m not holding a QB accountable for a team’s poor offensive performance if that QB wasn’t playing for most of the game anyway.

- The 9 points or less had to occur against an unranked opponent. They had to be ranked outside the AP Top 25 at the time of the game. I’m not holding an offense accountable if they lay an egg against Alabama, where practically every single player on their starting defense will go to the NFL. If they lay an egg against Wyoming, however, that’s a different story (no offense, Cowboys)

- I only looked at QBs at the FBS (I-A) level, just because the further back you go with stats at the FCS (I-AA) level and lower, the less you’re able to find, especially when it comes to game logs

- And finally, the QB had to throw more than 1 pass in the game to qualify. The reason for this comes in the 2017 Gasparilla Bowl with Florida International starting quarterback Alex McGough. In that game, FIU scored just 3 points against an unranked Temple. However, McGough went 1-for-1 and then broke his collarbone, not playing the rest of the way. It would be cruel to hold that against him, since any reasonable person can see that FIU scoring only 3 points is not McGough’s fault. Therefore, the “had to throw multiple passes” rule was put in place.

So, with that being said, what 21st century QBs fit this criteria?

**Part II: The Historic List**

Again, I’m only looking at teams to score less than 10 points in any game during a starting QB’s final season against an unranked opponent. If a QB from 2017 or 2018 is on the list, I’m only going to say that the pick was a bust if that player is no longer on the team, since it takes three years to truly evaluate a draft and a pick.

**Part III: The Ben Roethlisberger Exception**

~~Ben Roethlisberger is a bust and a horrible teammate that drove away Antonio Brown and nobody attended his 21st birthday party. Thanks for listening to my TED Talk.~~

Obviously, there’s one name that stands out on this list because he clearly does not belong, and it’s Ben Roethlisberger. Everyone else on that list that the jury is out on was either a massive bust, never played a snap, or never reached a status higher than a backup. There’s nobody that you could really argue was any good on that list… except for Roethlisberger, who’s going to be a Hall of Fame quarterback, is 6th all-time in passing yards, and won two Super Bowls and made it to a third. Yet, he’s on this list with guys like JP Losman, Casey Bramlet, DeShone Kizer, and Mike Teel. Something’s not adding up.

And it turns out, there’s a reason for that. In 2003, Miami (OH) started the season against an unranked Iowa team, with the Hawkeyes defeating the RedHawks 21-3. It was an awful game for Ben Roethlisberger; even though he completed 64.3% of his passes, he failed to throw a touchdown pass, and threw four interceptions in the process. This definitely meets the criteria for a game on this list.

But that unranked Iowa team was good… really good. The following week against Buffalo, they allowed just seven points. By the third week of the season, they were ranked inside the top 25, which is something that would last the rest of the season. Against a ranked Arizona State team, they allowed just two points, and held the Sun Devils and an offense led by Andrew Walter (a QB who would later get drafted by the Oakland Raiders in the third round in 2005) to just 184 yards. That Iowa team, as we later found out, deserved to be ranked, and as established in the criteria, a performance like that against a ranked opponent doesn’t count.

When all was said and done at the end of the 2003 season, the Hawkeyes were ranked 8th overall. They were a top 10 team. Of all the QBs on this list, Roethlisberger is the **only one** to play against a team that would end up finishing the season inside the top 10. Here’s a revised list where it shows the final ranking of each team.

Year of Draft | QB | School | Lowest Total | Opponent’s Final Ranking at End of Season
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2018 | Josh Allen | Wyoming | 3 points (vs. Iowa) | Unranked
2018 | Mike White | Western Kentucky | 7 points (vs. Illinois) | Unranked
2018 | Luke Falk | Washington State | 3 points (vs. California) | #19
2018 | Logan Woodside | Toledo | 0 points (vs. Appalachian State) | Unranked
2017 | DeShone Kizer | Notre Dame | 3 points (vs. NC State) | Unranked
2016 | Kevin Hogan | Stanford | 6 points (vs. Northwestern) | #23
2015 | Trevor Siemian | Northwestern | 7 points (vs. Iowa) | Unranked
2013 | Mike Glennon | NC State | 6 points (vs. Virginia) | Unranked
2010 | Dan LeFevour | Central Michigan | 6 points (vs. Arizona) | Unranked
2010 | Joe Webb | UAB | 7 points (vs. Marshall) | Unranked
2010 | Zac Robinson | Oklahoma State | 0 points (vs. Oklahoma) | Unranked
2009 | Mike Teel | Rutgers | 7 points (vs. Fresno State) | Unranked
2008 | Chad Henne | Michigan | 7 points (vs. Oregon) | #23
2008 | Kevin O’Connell | San Diego State | 7 points (vs. Utah) | Unranked
2007 | Trent Edwards | Stanford | 0 points (vs. UCLA) | Unranked
2006 | Charlie Whitehurst | Clemson | 9 points (vs. Georgia Tech) | Unranked
2006 | Brad Smith | Missouri | 3 points (vs. Kansas) | Unranked
2005 | Dan Orlovsky | Connecticut | 7 points (vs. Boston College) | #21
2005 | James Kilian | Tulsa | 0 points (vs. Navy) | #24
**2004** | **Ben Roethlisberger** | **Miami (OH)** | **3 points (vs. Iowa)** | **#8**
2004 | JP Losman | Tulane | 9 points (vs. Memphis) | Unranked
2004 | Luke McCown | Louisiana Tech | 6 points (vs. Fresno State) | Unranked
2004 | Jim Sorgi | Wisconsin | 5 points (vs. UNLV) | Unranked
2004 | Cody Pickett | Washington | 7 points (vs. California) | Unranked
2004 | Matt Mauck | LSU | 7 points (vs. Florida) | #24
2002 | Patrick Ramsey | Tulane | 6 points (vs. Southern Mississippi) | Unranked
2002 | Jeff Kelly | Southern Mississippi | 3 points (vs. UAB) | Unranked
2002 | Ronald Curry | North Carolina | 7 points (vs. Maryland) | #11
2001 | Sage Rosenfels | Iowa State | 7 points (vs. Texas A&amp;M) | Unranked
2001 | Josh Booty | LSU | 3 points (vs. Arkansas) | Unranked

To summarize, if we change the criteria and add in the caveat that if the unranked opponent finished the season inside the top 10, then not only does it eliminate Ben Roethlisberger from the list, but it keeps every other QB on there. Ben Roethlisberger is only on the list because the preseason voters grossly underestimated how the Hawkeyes would do that season.

**Part IV: The Analysis**

If we use the Ben Roethlisberger Exception here, and we exclude the three QBs drafted in 2018 that are still on the roster since the jury is still out on them (Josh Allen with Buffalo, Mike White with Dallas, Danny Etling with New England), there are 28 quarterbacks since the 2001 NFL Draft that meet this bad game criteria. I’d hesitate to call any of those 28 quarterbacks good. While some guys, such as Chad Henne, Sage Rosenfels, and Trevor Siemian were serviceable to an extent, but none of these guys are starter quality.

If you’re just looking at guys taken in the first two rounds of the draft, you’ve got Patrick Ramsey, JP Losman, Chad Henne, and DeShone Kizer. Of the 28 quarterbacks, 10 of them were taken in the seventh round, with 6 of them being taken in the sixth round. One could easily make the argument that the best case scenario when it comes to taking a QB in the sixth and seventh round, unless you’re the Patriots and have voodoo magic powers, is that they become a serviceable backup. However, of those 16 guys, only two of them are QBs that I’d consider to be serviceable backups- Trevor Siemian (round 7 in 2015) and Jim Sorgi (round 6 in 2004).

**Part V: Who to Avoid**

With all of that being said, what QBs at the FBS level meet this criteria? Which ones had horrific games this year against unranked opponents to the point that they are in trouble if this list holds up? For the purposes of this, we’re using the Ben Roethlisberger Exception (where if the opponent in question finished inside the top 10 when the season ended, it doesn’t count), just to be consistent across the board.

QB | School | Game That Meets Criteria
--- | --- | ---
Daniel Jones | Duke | 7 points vs. Wake Forest
Jarrett Stidham | Auburn | 9 points vs. Mississippi State
Clayton Thorson | Northwestern | 7 points vs. Duke
Nick Fitzgerald | Mississippi State | 7 points vs. Kentucky
Brent Stockstill | Middle Tennessee State | 7 points vs. Vanderbilt
Kyle Kempt | Iowa State | 3 points vs. Iowa
Malik Rosier | Miami (FL) | 3 points vs. Wisconsin
Justice Hansen | Arkansas State | 9 points vs. Appalachian State
Christian Chapman | San Diego State | 0 points vs. Ohio*
Gus Ragland | Miami (OH) | 0 points vs. Cincinnati
AJ Erdely | UAB | 3 points vs. Middle Tennessee State

*- Chapman only went 1-for-2 this game

I looked at every QB who [was in this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bu7VCs3ld5efCR3fDjj_vM09KjYbY_SBDkdJHRJPOew/edit?usp=sharing), which is what I use to know who’s in the draft. Some of these guys will likely not get drafted. However, others are projected to go quite high in the draft. There are people that have Daniel Jones of Duke going to the Giants in the first round, yet, he fits this criteria where there are no success stories since start of the 21st century.

**Part VI: Conclusion**

If a QB has a really bad game for his offense where the team struggles to move the ball down the field against an unranked opponent, then it’s probably not the best idea to draft said quarterback. Ben Roethlisberger is the only exception to this rule, but that was a very unique exception where Iowa was one of the best teams in the country and didn’t get the recognition at the start of the season that they deserved. If you include the Ben Roethlisberger Exception in the equation, where opponents that ended up finishing inside the top 10 at the end of the season are discarded from the sample size, then not a single quarterback on the list was a success story at the starter level. There’s a few serviceable backups here and there, but there’s nobody that was even halfway decent as a starting option.

**TL;DR:** Don’t draft QBs that had games where their offense sputtered against unranked opponents

429,RST's 2019 Draft Tracker,15,170,1,nfl,"Hi chaps

For the last 5 years or so I have been tracking the NFL draft on a spreadsheet. I was interested in seeing how well all the teams performed against pre-draft rankings, who reached and who had an eye for a bargain.

Over the years, I've added features as I've gone along. Two years ago I shared it with some friends, and last year shared it with a few more. For this year's version, several people told me I should share it with a wider audience, so here we are!

In the 2019 Draft Tracker, you can:

\&gt; Track every pick of the 2019 draft  
\&gt; See who reached, and who got a bargain based on aggregated ratings from 5 different draft sites  
\&gt; Become a draft expert by looking at team needs and top players available at those positions for every team  
\&gt; Check out the top 15 ranked available players at any point, plus the top 10 available at whichever position you specify  
\&gt; Input trades as they are made. Compare value and see who got the better deal. The sheet automatically assigns traded picks to their new owner  
\&gt; View more than 600 draft eligible players and the round they are projected to be picked in  
\&gt; Compare your mock draft with other experts, then see how you did compared to the real thing  
\&gt; Identify the best and worst drafters - which team got great value and which ones kept reaching?

Here are a few pictures of the tracker in action

[My favourite new feature for this year - trade tracker. Enter the teams and picks being traded, hit the button, and the sheet updates the draft order automatically](https://i.redd.it/m10k2xliogo21.png)

If you fancy having a go with the Draft Tracker, you can download it [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tkui2a0ldfwp1db/Draft%20Tracker%202019%20v1.1.xlsm?dl=0). There is a User Guide sheet in there with more screenshots and step-by-step instructions on how to use the file.

It is worth noting that this file is up to date as of yesterday (one month out from the draft!), but I will probably update the file once more a week or so out from the draft.

This Tracker is very much a labour of love, and I've spent hundreds of hours working on what you see here. Any and all feedback is very welcome here, or via my email found in the Tracker. Enjoy!

*One last note - this tracker was made with Microsoft Excel 2016 Version 1902. Please let me know if you have any compatibility issues and I will see what I can do!*"

433,[OC] 72% of Dwayne Haskins' catchable passes in 2018 were either behind the line of scrimmage or within the first 10 yards after it. That's higher than every other QB prospect in the last four draft classes...by a lot.,71,73,0,nfl,"I noticed while watching Haskins on film that he really favors getting the ball out quickly and dissecting defenses underneath with the rhythm passing game. After looking at these numbers, which are all are sourced from Ian Wharton's excellent QB passing charts for the last four years, that first impression was definitely backed up. 

Here are some numbers for all of the other major QB prospects to come out since 2016, showing their total number of catchable passes in their final years of college and what percentage of those passes were either within 10 yards or behind the LOS. The only guys that even come remotely CLOSE to Haskins are Mahomes, Rosen, and Paxton Lynch in their respective years. 

**2018 Haskins:** 373/520 72% 

**2018 Murray:** 202/353 57% 

**2017 Rosen:** 278/416 67% 

**2017 Jackson:** 257/404 63% 

**2017 Darnold:** 283/457 62% 

**2017 Mayfield:** 225/384 58% 

**2017 Allen:**149/255 58% 

**2016 Mahomes:** 330/476 69% 

**2016 Watson:** 307/490 63% 

**2016 Trubisky:** 218/353 62% 

**2016 Kizer:** 197/334 59% 

**2015 Lynch:** 255/368 69% 

**2015 Goff:** 325/499 65% 

**2015 Wentz:** 116/179 65% 

Obviously this percentage doesn't signal anything inherently good or bad about Haskins as a prospect because Mahomes' and Lynch's careers took very, very different paths, but I just found it extremely interesting how much his playing style shined through in his actual statistics.

Today is the 30th overall pick, which is currently held by the Packers this year.

The metric I’m using in this countdown is PFR’s [Approximate Value](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html). This is hardly an end-all, be-all, so please take the order in which the names appear with a grain of salt.

But with all of that out of the way, here are the best players to ever be taken 30th overall:

I decided to adjust pro football reference's adjusted net yards per attempt statistic with PFF's game charting stats, so that it would be independent of drops, YAC, spikes, throwaways, and hit while throwing.

Here are some notes on the methodology:

* I assumed the average YAC per reception of 5.113.
* A different yards/sack for each player would have been too tedious, and is probably fairly random. I just used the average of 6.11. 
* I used +20 for TDs and -45 for INTs like pro football reference does.
* Sack:att is the ratio of sacks to pass attempt, not sacks per dropback. It made things simpler as I was adjusting ny/a, that's all.
* So the formula is [Accuracy%(5.113+ADoT)-6.11(sack:att)]/[1+sack:att]+20(td/play)-45(int/play.) Its complex because I CBA to enter the raw totals for accurate passes and aimed attempts. The math is right, trust me.^^^Even_though_it_put_Flacco_at_7

Edit: 

**Glossary**

Accuracy: (completions+drops)/(attempts-throwaways-spikes-hit while throwing)  
ADoT: average depth of target  
adjusted y/a: predicted y/a based on accuracy, depth of target, and league average YaC of 5.113 per reception.  
adjusted ny/a: adjusted y/a, but with sacks counted as attempts, and the average loss of 6.11 yards assumed per sack.  
adjusted any/a: adjusted ny/a with a 45 yard penalty for INTs, and a 20 yard bonus for TDs.

497,FFDB - Easy to use CLI and Engine to create NFL database,2,11,0,nfl,"Hey everyone, I've been working on creating a tool for developers to easily create their own NFL databases for football or fantasy purposes.

I myself had been looking to create my own app for a long time, but getting the data you want easily from a single source wasn't as easy as it should be. With this tool, you can easily create your own PostgreSql or Mongo databases in a single command. If you don't like the schema, or want to use the engine to populate a different database, you can implement an interface and the Engine will do it for you.

Here's the repository page, which includes all the instructions to get the program, along with API documentation for the CLI commands:

[https://github.com/rushfive/FFDB](https://github.com/rushfive/FFDB)

For quick reference, the Engine provides data such as player information (names, draft profiles, college, etc), teams, every important stat type for players and teams (from 2010 to the present), and weekly matchups.

I have it released in an alpha state right now, although it's pretty much feature-complete. I'm open to feedback on the database schemas I've created for PG/Mongo.

Would love to hear any thoughts, ideas, or recommendations from the community.

Have fun and cheers!
